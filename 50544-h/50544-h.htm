  <h2 class='c005'><span class='xlarge'><b>INTRODUCTION.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> following pages are principally written by the pen of the
hero of our age, that pure-hearted man—that devoted patriot,
and noble, generous, and disinterested philanthropist—that
spirited, undaunted, and indomitable warrior, whose splendid
deeds have dazzled the world, and whose career, according to
his own recent declaration, will be brought to its close by a
final triumph, for which he is now preparing, to be gained early
in the present year.</p>

<p class='c007'>While General Garibaldi resided in New York and its vicinity,
in the years 1850 and '51, the author of this book enjoyed
his acquaintance, and the favor of receiving from him his private
memoirs, with permission to translate and publish them.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
They had just been prepared for the press, when Garibaldi
requested that they might be withholden from the public while
he remained in this country, probably because he preferred to
be unnoticed, being at that time employed in making candles
on Staten Island, and naturally fond of retirement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first part of this volume, to page 210, contains a literal
translation from his original private manuscripts, in which a
clear, unadorned English style was adopted, as nearly corresponding,
as the translator's abilities would allow, to the manly
and pure Italian of the author. No attempt was made to
<a id='Page_v'></a>change, by dilating or polishing, as the translator believed it to
be almost as hopeless to improve his style as to rival him with
the sword. That portion of the volume relates to his early life,
and the fourteen years he spent in the service of the Republican
cause in South America.</p>

<p class='c007'>The succeeding pages are devoted to his services in Italy in
the revolutions of 1849, 1859 and 1860; and a large proportion
of their contents is occupied by his proclamations and other
documents of his own, in translating which the same efforts
have been made to render them correctly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author has received assistance from some of the countrymen
of Garibaldi in New York, for information not otherwise
to be obtained, several of whom have been his fellow-soldiers.
Many extracts have been taken from the most authentic and
interesting descriptions, by intelligent eye-witnesses, of scenes
in the two last campaigns in Italy. A personal acquaintance
with Italy and Italians has enabled the writer to select, arrange,
and explain the vast amount of materials presented by those
most extraordinary seasons, in a manner perhaps best adapted
for his readers. Some omissions were necessary, in composing
a work of this kind, but nothing of essential importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader can hardly fail to bear in mind, while here reviewing
the life of this wonderful man, the most formidable of
modern times, who is at the same time one of the most gentle
and amiable at heart, that even now the present pause in his
career is a solemn one, as it is speedily to be followed by a
scene of excitement, conflict and consequences, perhaps unequalled
by those which are past. The results none can foresee:
but it is evident that they must be momentous and
extensive, whether prosperous or adverse; and no intelligent
American can anticipate them without deep emotion. Well
may we look to heaven for the protection and success of the
noble hero of Italian independence and liberty, the avowed
enemy of the Papal Anti-Christ, whom he unmasks and denounces,
and for the diffusion among his countrymen of that
pure and undefiled Christianity, of which he declares himself a
believer, and which he so earnestly claims for the religion of
Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The efforts, sacrifices, and sufferings of thousands of Italians
for the independence, freedom, and happiness of their country,
<a id='Page_vi'></a>have been such, in past years, as to present pages worthy of
record in history for the honor of mankind, and lessons for other
nations. Many of the purest men have been suffering the pains
and sorrows of exile in our own land, some of them after long and
cruel punishment in the dungeons of Austria, those of the brutal
kings of Naples, or of the Pope of Rome. With a patience and
magnanimity astonishing to witness, they have justly excited
the respect, love, and admiration of Americans who knew them,
and ever showed themselves sincere and cordial friends of our
country, our institutions, and state of society. Unlike too many
other foreigners, they have been content with the protection
which they enjoyed, and never sought for office or power, much
less to act as the servants of European despots, to undermine
American liberty. Some of these noble men, on returning to
Italy, left with us records of their lives, which may, perhaps,
hereafter be published, according to their desire, to promote a
warm attachment between our countrymen and their own, for
which those writings are admirably adapted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following pages contain the translation of one of the
collections of manuscripts here referred to, and it is most gratifying
to the translator to bring before the American public, at
this time, so appropriate, interesting, and authentic a biography
of the admired man of our age, under his own authority, and
from his own pen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could there be a character better adapted as a model for
American youth, in training them to just views of the value
of what has been called the humble virtues of common life?
The example of Garibaldi displays those virtues which adorn
every pure, honest, and disinterested character, in happy contrast
with the false and selfish principles which are too generally
approved, admired, and recommended to the young. How
much the world owes him, for his disinterested career, his devotion
to the good of others, his refusal of rewards of every
kind, and his preference of simple life in a lonely, rocky island,
with only his son and daughter, and a few true friends, to all
the honors, riches, and luxuries of the European capitals!</p>

<p class='c007'>And how noble an example, also, have the Italians given us
of union!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='xlarge'><b>LIFE OF</b></span><br /> <br /><span class='xxlarge'><b>GENERAL GARIBALDI.</b></span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c001'><span class='xlarge'><b>CHAPTER I.</b></span></h3>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'><b>MY FATHER—MY MOTHER—HER INFLUENCE ON MY LIFE—INCIDENTS
OF MY CHILDHOOD—MY FIRST SCHOOLMASTERS.</b></span></p>
<p class='c006'>In commencing an account of my life, it would be unpardonable
in me to omit speaking of my kind parents.
My father, a sailor, and the son of a sailor, educated
me in the best manner he could in Nice, my native
city, and afterwards trained me to the life of a seaman
in a vessel with himself. He had navigated vessels of
his own in his youth; but a change of fortune had
compelled him afterwards to serve in those belonging
to his father. He used often to tell his children that
he would gladly have left them richer; but I am fully
convinced that the course which he adopted in our education
was the best he possibly could have taken, and
that he procured for us the best instructors he was
able, perhaps sometimes at the expense of his own convenience.
If, therefore, I was not trained in a gymnasium,
it was by no means owing to his want of desire.</p>

<p class='c007'>In mentioning my mother—I speak it with pride—she
was a model for mothers; and, in saying this, I
<a id='Page_14'></a>have said all that can be said. One of the greatest
sorrows of my life is, that I am not able to brighten
the last days of my good parent, whose path I have
strewed with so many sorrows by my adventurous career.
Her tender affection for me has, perhaps, been
excessive; but do I not owe to her love, to her angel-like
character, the little good that belongs to mine?
To the piety of my mother, to her beneficent and charitable
nature, do I not, perhaps, owe that little love of
country which has gained for me the sympathy and affection
of my good, but unfortunate fellow-citizens?
Although certainly not superstitious, often, amidst the
most arduous scenes of my tumultuous life, when I have
passed unharmed through the breakers of the ocean, or
the hail-storms of battle, she has seemed present with
me. I have in fancy seen her on her knees before the
Most High—my dear mother!—imploring for the life
of her son; and I have believed in the efficacy of her
prayers.</p>

<p class='c007'>I spent my childhood in the joys and sorrows familiar
to children, without the occurrence of anything
very remarkable. Being more fond of play than of
study, I learned but little, and made but a poor return
for the kind exertions of my parents for my education.
A very simple accident made a deep impression on my
memory. One day, when a very little boy, I caught a
grasshopper, took it into the house, and, in handling
it, broke its leg. Reflecting on the injury I had done
to the harmless insect, I was so much affected with
<a id='Page_15'></a>grief, that I retired to my chamber, mourned over the
poor little creature, weeping bitterly for several hours.
On another occasion, while accompanying my cousin
in hunting, I was standing on the side of a deep ditch,
by which the fields were irrigated, when I discovered
that a poor woman, while washing clothes, had
fallen from the bank, and was in imminent danger.
Although I was quite young and small, I jumped down
and saved her life; and my success afforded me the
highest pleasure. On that occasion, and in various
other circumstances of a similar kind, I never hesitated
for a moment, or thought of my own safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among my teachers, I retain a grateful recollection
of Padre Gianone and Signor Arena. Under the former
I made but very little progress, being bent more
on play than on learning; but I have often regretted
my loss in failing to learn English, whenever I have
since been thrown in company with persons speaking
that language. To the latter I consider myself greatly
indebted for what little I know. The ignorance in
which I was kept of the language of Italy, and of subjects
connected with her condition and highest interests,
was common among the young, and greatly to be
lamented. The defect was especially great in Nice,
where few men knew how to be Italians, in consequence
of the vicinity and influence of France, and
still more the neglect of the government to provide a
proper education for the people. To the instructions
of Padre Gianone, and the incitement given me by my
<a id='Page_16'></a>elder brother Angelo, who wrote to me from America
to study my native language, I acknowledge my obligations
for what knowledge I possess of that most beautiful
of languages. To my brother's influence, also, I
owe it, that I then read Roman and Italian history
with much interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>This sketch of my early youth I must close, with the
narration of a little expedition which I attempted to
carry into effect—my first adventure. Becoming weary
of school in Genoa, and disgusted with the confinement
which I suffered at the desk, I one day proposed
to several of my companions to make our escape,
and seek our fortune. No sooner said than done. We
got possession of a boat, put some provisions on board,
with fishing tackle, and sailed for the Levant. But
we had not gone as far as Monaco, when we were pursued
and overtaken by a "corsair," commanded by good father.
We were captured without bloodshed, and taken back to our
homes, exceedingly mortified by the failure of our enterprise,
and disgusted with an Abbé who had betrayed our flight. Two
of my companions on that occasion were Cesare Tanoli and
Raffaele Deandreis.</p>

<p class='c007'>When I recur to the principles which were inculcated
at school, and the motives used to encourage us to
study, I am now able to understand their unsoundness
and their evil tendency. We were in danger of growing
up with only selfish and mercenary views: nothing
was offered us as a reward for anything we could do,
but money.</p>

bark in which I was to navigate the Mediterranean,
when I stepped on board as a sailor for the first time!
Her lofty sides, her slender masts, rising so gracefully
and so high above, and the bust of Our Lady which
adorned the bow, all remain as distinctly painted on
my memory at the present day, as on the happy hour
when I became one of her crew. How gracefully
moved the sailors, who were fine young men from San
Remi, and true specimens of the intrepid Ligurians!
With what pleasure I ventured into the forecastle, to
listen to their popular songs, sung by harmonious
choirs! They sang of love, until I was transported;
and they endeavored to excite themselves to patriotism
by singing of Italy! But who, in those days, had ever
taught them how to be patriots and Italians? Who,
indeed, had then ever said, on those shores, to those
<a id='Page_18'></a>young men, that there was such a thing as Italy, or
that they had a country to be ameliorated and redeemed?</p>

<p class='c007'>The commander of the Costanza, the vessel in which
I had embarked, was Angelo Pesante. He was the
best sea-captain I ever knew, and ought to have the
command of a ship of war of the first class, as soon as
Italy shall have such a fleet as she deserves,—for a
better commander could not be. He has, indeed, been
captain of an armed vessel. Pesante was able to
make or invent every thing that could be wanted in a
vessel of any kind whatsoever, from a fishing-boat to
a ship of the line; and, if he were in the service of
the country, she would reap the advantage and the
glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>My second voyage was made to Rome, in a vessel
of my father's. Rome, once the capital of the world,
now the capital of a sect! The Rome which I had
painted in my imagination, no longer existed. The
future Rome, rising to regenerate the nation, has now
long been a dominant idea in my mind, and inspired
me with hope and energy. Thoughts, springing from
the past, in short, have had a prevailing influence on
me during my life. Rome, which I had before admired
and thought of frequently, I ever since have
loved. It has been dear to me beyond all things. I
not only admired her for her former power and the
remains of antiquity, but even the smallest thing connected
with her was precious to me. Even in exile,
<a id='Page_19'></a>these feelings were constantly cherished in my heart;
and often, very often, have I prayed to the Almighty
to permit me to see that city once more. I regarded
Rome as the centre of Italy, for the union of which I
ardently longed.</p>

<p class='c007'>I made several voyages with my father, and afterwards
one with Captain Guiseppe Gervino, to Caglieri,
in a brig named the Emma, during which, on the
return passage, I witnessed a melancholy shipwreck,
at a distance, in such a storm that it was impossible to
render any assistance. In that instance I witnessed,
for the first time, that tender sympathy which sailors
generally feel for others in distress. We saw
Spaniards, in a Catalan felucca, struggling with the
waves, who soon sank before our eyes, while my
honest and warm-hearted shipmates shed tears over
their hard fate. This disaster was caused by a sudden
change of wind when the sea and wind were high.
A Libaccio, a south-west wind, had been blowing
furiously for several days, and a number of vessels
were in sight, of all which the felucca seemed to make
the best way. We were all steering for Vado, to
make that port for shelter, until the storm should subside.
A horrible surge unexpectedly broke over the
Spanish vessel, and overset it in an instant. We saw
the crew clinging to the side, and heard their cries to
us for assistance, while we could perceive their signals,
but could not launch a boat. They all soon disappeared
in the foam of a second surge, more terrible
<a id='Page_20'></a>than the first. We afterwards heard that the nine
persons thus lost all belonged to one family.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Vado I went to Genoa, and thence to Nice,
whence I commenced a series of voyages to the
Levant, in vessels belonging to the house of Givan.
In one of these, in the brig Centesi, Captain Carlo
Seneria, I was left sick in Constantinople. The vessel
sailed; and, as my sickness continued, I found myself
in somewhat straitened circumstances. In cases of
difficulty or danger, I have never, in all my life, been
disheartened. I then had the fortune to meet with
persons kindly disposed to assist me, and, among
others, I can never forget Signora Luigia Saiyuraiga,
of Nice, whom I have ever since regarded as one
of the most accomplished of women, in the virtues
which distinguish the best and most admirable of her
sex.</p>

<p class='c007'>As mother and wife, she formed the happiness
of her husband, who was an excellent man, and of
their young and interesting children, whose education
she conducted with the greatest care and skill. What
contributed to prolong my abode in the capital of
Turkey, was the war which at that time commenced
between that power and Russia; and I then, for the
first time, engaged as a teacher of children. That
employment was offered me by Signor Diego, a doctor
in medicine, who introduced me to the widow
Temoin, who wanted an instructor for her family.
I took up my residence in the house, and was
<a id='Page_21'></a>placed in charge of her three sons, with a sufficient
salary.</p>

<p class='c007'>I afterwards resumed the nautical life, embarking
in the brig Nostra Signora della Grazia, Captain
Casabana; and that vessel was the first I ever
commanded, being made Captain of it on a subsequent
voyage to Mahon and Gibraltar, returning to Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being an ardent lover of Italy from my childhood,
I felt a strong desire to become initiated in the
mysteries of her restoration; and I sought everywhere
for books and writings which might enlighten
me on the subject, and for persons animated with
feelings corresponding with my own. On a voyage
which I made to Tagangog, in Russia, with a young
Ligurian, I was first made acquainted with a few
things connected with the intentions and plans of the
Italian patriots; and surely Columbus did not enjoy
so much satisfaction on the discovery of America, as
I experienced on hearing that the redemption of our
country was meditated. From that time I became
entirely devoted to that object, which has since
been appropriately my own element for so long a
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The speedy consequence of my entire devotion to
the cause of Italy was, that on the fifth of February,
1834, I was passing out of the gate of Linterna, of
Genoa, at seven o'clock in the evening, in the disguise
of a peasant—<i>a proscript</i>. At that time my public life
<a id='Page_22'></a>commenced; and, a few days after, I saw my name,
for the first time, in a newspaper: but it was in <i>a
sentence of death</i>!</p>

<p class='c007'>I remained in Marseilles, unoccupied, for several
months; but at length embarked, as mate, in a vessel
commanded by Captain Francesco Gazan. While
standing on board, towards evening, one day, dressed
in my best suit, and just ready to go on shore, I heard
a noise in the water, and, looking below, discovered
that some person had fallen into the sea, and was then
under the stern of the vessel. Springing into the water,
I had the satisfaction to save from drowning a French
boy, in the presence of a large collection of people,
who expressed their joy aloud, and warmly applauded
the act. His name was Joseph Rasbaud, and he
was fourteen years of age. His friends soon made
their appearance; and I experienced very peculiar
feelings excited in my heart, when the tears
of his mother dropped, one after another, upon
my cheek, while I heard the thanks of the whole
family.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some years before I had a similar good fortune,
when I saved the life of my friend, Claudio Terese.</p>

<p class='c006'>I made another voyage to the Black Sea, in the
brig Unione, and afterwards one to Tunis, in a frigate,
built at Merseilles for the Bey. From the latter port
I next sailed for Rio Janeiro, in the Nautonier, a
Nantes brig, Captain Beauregard.</p>

<p class='c007'>While walking one day in a public place in Rio, I
met a man whose appearance struck me in a very uncommon
and very agreeable manner. He fixed his
eyes on me at the same moment, smiled, stopped, and
spoke. Although we found that we had never met
before, our acquaintance immediately commenced, and
we became unreserved and cordial friends for life.
He was Rosetti, the most generous among the warm
lovers of our poor country!</p>

<p class='c007'>I spent several months in Rio, unoccupied and at
ease, and then engaged in commerce, in company with
Rosetti: but a short experience convinced us that
neither of us was born for a merchant.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_24'></a>About this time Zambeccari arrived at Rio, having
been sent as a prisoner from Rio Grande, when I
became acquainted with the sentiments and situation
of the people of that province. Arrangements were
soon made for Rosetti and myself to proceed on an
expedition for their aid, they having declared their
independence. Having obtained the necessary papers,
we engaged a small vessel for a crusier, which I named
"<i>The Mazzini</i>." I soon after embarked in a garopera,
with twenty companions, to aid a people in the south,
oppressed by a proud and powerful enemy. The
garope is a kind of Brazilian fish, of an exquisite
flavor; and boats employed in taking it are called
garoperas. My feelings, at that epoch of my life,
were very peculiar. I was enlisted in a new and
hazardous enterprize, and, for the first time, turned a
helm for the ocean with a warlike flag flying over my
head—the flag of a republic—the Republic of Rio
Grande. I was at the head of a resolute band, but it
was a mere handful, and my enemy was the empire
of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c007'>We sailed until we reached the latitude of Grand
Island, off which we met a sumaca, or large coasting
boat, named the Luisa, loaded with coffee. We
captured her without opposition, and then resolved to
take her instead of my own vessel, having no pilot for
the high sea, and thinking it necessary to proceed
along the coast. I therefore transferred everything
from the Mazzini on board the sumaca, and then sunk
<a id='Page_25'></a>the former. But I soon found that my crew were not all
men like Rosetti, of noble and disinterested character
and the purest morals; and, indeed, I had before
felt some apprehensions, when I saw among them
several physiognomies by no means prepossessing. I
now found them, when on board the sumaca, affecting
ferocity, to intimidate the poor Brazilian sailors,
whom we had made prisoners. I took immediate
steps to repress all such conduct, and to tranquilize
the fears which they had excited, assuring the crew
that they should be uninjured and kindly treated, and
set on shore at the first convenient landing-place, with
all their own personal property. A Brazilian, a passenger
in the sumaca, took the first opportunity, after
coming on board, to offer me a casket containing
three valuable diamonds, in a supplicating manner, as
if afraid for his life; but I refused to receive it, and
gave peremptory orders that none of the effects of the
crew or passengers should be taken from them, under
any pretext whatever. And this course I pursued on
all subsequent occasions, whenever I took any prizes
from the enemy; and my orders were always strictly
obeyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The passengers and crew were landed north of
Itaparica, the launches of the Luisa being given to
them, with all their movables, and as much brandy as
they chose to take with them. I then went to the south,
and soon arrived in the port of Maldonado, where
the favorable reception given us by the authorities
<a id='Page_26'></a>and the people, afforded us a very flattering prospect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosetti set off for Montevideo, to arrange things connected
with the expedition, leaving us to await his
return; and during eight days we enjoyed one uninterrupted
festival among the hospitable inhabitants.
The close of that period of gayety would have been
tragical, if the political chief of the town had been less
friendly than he proved himself to be. I received
unexpected notice, quite different from what I had
been led to expect, that the flag of Rio Grande was
not recognized, and that an order had arrived for our
immediate arrest. Thus compelled to depart, although
the weather was threatening, I hoisted sail without
delay, and steered up the river Plata, with scarcely
any plan or object, and almost without opportunity
to communicate to any one that I should await, at the
Point of Jesus Maria, news of the result of Rosetti's
deliberations with his friends in Montevideo. After a
wearisome navigation, I reached that place, having
narrowly escaped shipwreck on the Point of Piedras
Negras, in consequence of a variation of the compass
caused by the muskets placed near it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I found no news at that place; and our provisions
were entirely consumed. We had no boat to land
with: but it was indispensable to procure food for the
men. At length, after some deliberation, having discovered
a house about four miles distant from the shore,
I determined to get to the land, by some means or
<a id='Page_27'></a>other, and, at any cost, to procure provisions and bring
them on board. The shore being very difficult of approach,
because the wind was blowing from the pampas,
the vast plains which extend far and wide, it was
necessary to throw out two anchors to draw up a little
nearer. I then embarked on the dining table, accompanied
by one of my sailors, named Maurizio Garibaldi,
and moved on towards the land, not navigating, but
rolling through the breakers of that dangerous shore.
In spite of the difficulty attending the enterprise we
reached the river's bank in safety, and drew up our
strange craft on the sand. Then, leaving my companion
and namesake to refit, I set off for the house
which I had seen from the vessel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walking up the bank I reached the level of the
pampas, and then, for the first time in my life, caught
a view of one of those vast South American plains.
I was struck with admiration:—such a boundless scene
of fertility, where wild horses and cattle were running
free and unrestrained, feeding, resting, and racing at
full speed, at will. My mind was filled with new, sublime
and delightful emotions, as I passed on towards
the solitary habitation to which I was bound. When
I reached it I found a welcome, and easily obtained a
promise of an abundant supply of food for my crew.
The daughter of the proprietor of that vast estate was
an educated, refined and agreeable young lady, and
even a poetess; and I spent the remainder of the day
<a id='Page_28'></a>very pleasantly, in company with her and the rest of
the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day I returned to the shore, with the quarters
of a fat bullock which had been killed for me out
of the immense herd of cattle, at the order of the proprietor.
Maurizio and I fastened the meat to the legs
of the table, which were in the air, the table itself
being placed upside down on the water, and then we
launched out into the river to make our way to the
vessel. But the weight of the cargo and crew proved
entirely too great, and we immediately began to sink
until we stood in the water; and on reaching the
breakers, the agitation caused so much rocking that it
was almost impossible to proceed, or even to keep our
footing. Indeed, we were in actual danger of drowning.
But, after great exertions, we reached the Luisa
with our load of provisions, and were hailed by the
shouts of our companions, whose only hope for subsistence
depended on our success.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day, while passing a small vessel called a
Balandra, we thought of purchasing her launch, which
we saw on her deck. We therefore made sail, boarded
her, and made the purchase for thirty dollars. That
day also we spent in sight of Jesus Maria.</p>

WOUND—RESULTS—MY OWN CONDITION—BURIAL OF MY FRIEND
FIORENTINO.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>The day after, while lying a little south of Jesus
Maria, two launches came in sight and approached us
in a friendly manner, with nothing in their appearance
to excite suspicion. I made a signal agreed on with
friends, but it was not answered; and then I hoisted
sail, had the arms taken from the chests, and prepared
to meet them as enemies. The launches held on
towards us: the larger showed only three men on deck:
but, when she came nearer, called on us to surrender, in
the name of the Oriental Government. The next
instant thirty men suddenly rose, as if by a miracle,
and she ran up on our larboard side. I immediately
gave command to "brace the yards," and then to "fire."
An active engagement then commenced. The launch
being then alongside of us, several of the enemy
attempted to board us, but were driven back by a few
shots and sabre-cuts. All this passed in a few moments.
But my order to brace the yards was not
obeyed, for my men were new and in confusion, and
the few who began to haul at the weather braces found
they had not been let go to leeward, and were unable
<a id='Page_30'></a>to move them. Fiorentino, one of the best of the
crew, who was at the helm, sprang forward to cast them
off, when a musket ball struck him in the head and laid
him dead on deck. The helm was now abandoned;
and, as I was standing near, firing at the enemy, I
seized the tiller, but the next moment received a bullet
in my neck, which threw me down senseless, and I
knew nothing more until the action was over. When
I came to myself I found that an hour had elapsed, a
hard fight had been maintained against a superior
force, and a victory won, chiefly by the bravery of the
Italians, the mate, Luigi Carniglia, the second mate,
Pasquale Lodola, and the sailors Giovanni Lamberti
and Maurizio Garibaldi. Two Maltese and all the
Italians, except a Venitian, fought bravely. The
others, with two negroes, sheltered themselves under
the ballast of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c007'>I found that the enemy had hauled off out of gun-shot.
I ordered that our vessel should proceed up the
river, in search of a place of retreat. When I first
began to recover consciousness, I lay helpless, apparently
dead, but felt as if unable to die. I was the
only man on board who had any knowledge of navigation;
and, as none of the others had a single idea of
geography, or knew where to go, they at length
brought me the chart. None of us had been in the
waters of the Plata before, except Maurizio, who had
sailed on the Uruguay. When I turned my dying
eyes on the chart, I was unable to see distinctly, but
<a id='Page_31'></a>made out to perceive that one place on the river was
printed in large letters, and at length discovered that
it was Santa Fé, on the Paraná, and thought we might
there make a temporary harbor. So, pointing at it
with my finger, and signifying as well as I could the
direction and distance, I left the helmsman to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the sailors, except the Italians, were frightened
by seeing my situation, and the corpse of Fiorentino,
and by the apprehension of being treated as pirates
wherever they might go. Every countenance wore an
expression of terror; and at the earliest opportunity
they deserted. In every bird they observed on the
water they imagined they saw an enemy's launch, sent
to pursue them. The body of the unfortunate Fiorentino
was buried the next day in the river, with the
ceremonies usually practised by sailors, as we were
unable to anchor anywhere near the land. I was perhaps
affected the more by the sad scene, because I was
in so feeble a condition. I had never thought much
about death, although I knew I was liable to it every
moment; but I mourned deeply at the funeral of my
lost friend, who was very dear indeed to me.
Among the numerous poetical lines which occurred to
my mind, was that beautiful verse of Ugo Foscolo:</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_32'></a>My friend had promised me never to bury me in the
water: but who can tell whether he would have been
able to keep his promise? I could never have felt
sure that my corpse would not feed the sea-wolves and
acaves of the great river Plata. If it were so, then I
should never have seen Italy again; never fought for
her—which was the great wish of my life: but then,
too, I never should have seen her sink into ignominy.
Who would have said to the amiable man that, within
a year, Garibaldi would see him swallowed up in the
surges of the ocean, and that he would search for his
corpse, to bury it on a foreign shore, and to mark the
spot with a stone, for the eyes of strangers? He
deserved my kind regard; for he attended me, with the
care of a mother, during the whole voyage from Mayaguay.
During all my sufferings, which were very
severe, I had no relief but what he afforded me, by his
constant care and kind services. I wish to express
my gratitude to God for sending me such a friend.</p>

SUDDEN DEPARTURE AND RETURN—CRUEL TREATMENT—SEÑORA
ALEMAN—TRIBUTE TO THAT NOBLE LADY—GO TO BAJADA.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>Our vessel arrived at Gualaguay, where we were very
cordially received and kindly treated by Captain
Luca Tartabal, of the schooner Pintoresca, and his
passengers, inhabitants of that town. That vessel had
met ours in the neighborhood of Hiem, and, on being
asked for provisions by Luigi, they had offered to
keep company with us to their destination. They
warmly recommended us to the governor of the province,
Don Pasquale Echague, who was pleased, when
going away, to leave his own surgeon with me, Dr.
Ramon del Orco, a young Argentine. He soon extracted
the ball from my neck and cured me. I resided
in the house of Don Jacinto Andreas during the
six months which I spent in that place, and was under
great obligations to him for his kindness and courtesy,
as well as for those which I received from his family.</p>

<p class='c007'>But I was not free. With all the friendliness of
Echague, and the sympathy shown me by the inhabitants
of the town, I was not permitted to leave it without
the permission of Rosas, the traitor of Buenos
<a id='Page_34'></a>Ayres, who never acted for a good reason. My wound
being healed, I was allowed to take rides on horseback,
even to a distance of twelve miles, and was
supplied with a dollar a day for my subsistence, which
was a large sum for that country, where there is but
little opportunity to spend money. But all this was
not liberty. I was then given to understand by certain
persons (whether friends or enemies), that it had been
ascertained that the government would not wish to
prevent my escape if I should attempt it. I therefore
determined to gain my freedom, believing that it
would be easier than it proved, and that the attempt
would not be regarded as a serious offence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commandant of Gualaguay was named Millau.
He had not treated me ill, but it was very doubtful
what his feelings towards me really were, as he had
never expressed any interest in me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having after a time formed my plan, I began to make
preparations. One evening, while the weather was tempestuous,
I left home and went in the direction of a
good old man, whom I was accustomed to visit at his
residence, three miles from Gualaguay. On arriving, I
got him to describe with precision the way which I intended
to take, and engaged him to find me a guide,
with horses, to conduct me to Hueng, where I hoped
to find vessels in which I might go, <i>incognito</i>, to Buenos
Ayres and Montevideo. Horses and a guide were
procured. I had fifty-four miles to travel, and that
distance I <i>devoured</i> in less than half a night, going
<a id='Page_35'></a>almost the whole way on the gallop. When day broke,
we were at an estancia, within about half a mile of the
town. My guide then told me to wait in the bushes
where we were, while he went to inquire the news at
the house. I complied, and he left me. I dismounted
and tied my horse to a tree with the bridle, and waited
a long time. At length, not seeing him return, I
walked to the edge of the bushes, and looked about
in search of him, when I heard behind me a trampling
of horses; and, on turning round, discovered a band
of horsemen, who were rushing upon me with their sabres
drawn. They were already between me and my
horse, and any attempt to escape would have been
fruitless—still more any effort at resistance. I was
immediately seized and bound, with my hands behind
me, and then placed upon a miserable horse, and had my
feet tied under him. In that condition I was taken back
to Gualaguay, where still worse treatment awaited me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such were the impressions made upon my feelings
by the barbarous usage which I received at that time,
that I have never since been able to recall the circumstances
without a peculiar agitation of mind; and I
regard that period as the most painful of my life.</p>

<p class='c007'>When brought into the presence of Millau, who was
waiting for me at the door of the prison, he asked me
who had furnished me with the means of escape.
When he found that he could draw no information
from me on that subject, he began to beat me most
brutally with a club which he had in his hand. He
<a id='Page_36'></a>then put a rope over a beam in the prison, and hung
me up in the air by my hands, bound together as they
were. For two hours the wretch kept me suspended
in that manner. My whole body was thrown into a
high, feverish heat. I felt as if burning in a furnace.
I frequently swallowed water, which was allowed me,
but without being able to quench my raging thirst. The
sufferings which I endured after being unbound were
indescribable: yet I did not complain. I lay like
a dead man; and it is easy to believe that I must
have suffered extremely. I had first travelled fifty-four
miles through a marshy country, where the insects
are insufferable at that season of the year, and then I
had returned the same distance, with my hands and
feet bound, and entirely exposed to the terrible stings
of the zingara, or mosquito, which assailed me with
vigor; and, after all this, I had to undergo the tortures
of Millau, who had the heart of an assassin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Andreas, the man who had assisted me, was put into
prison; and all the inhabitants were terrified, so that,
had it not been for the generous spirit of a lady, I
probably should have lost my life. That lady was
Señora Aleman, to whom I love to express my gratitude.
She is worthy of the warmest terms of admiration,
and deserves the title of "angelo generoso di
bontà" (generous angel of goodness). Spurning every
suggestion of fear, she came forward to the assistance
of the tortured prisoner; and from that time I wanted
nothing—thanks to my benefactress!</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_37'></a>A few days after, I was removed to Bajada, the capital
of the province, and I remained a prisoner in that
city for two months. I was then informed, by Governor
Echague, that I should be allowed to leave the
province. Although I professed different principles
from his, and had fought for a different cause, I have
ever been ready to acknowledge my obligations to
that officer, and always desired an opportunity to
prove my gratitude to him for granting me everything
that was in his power to give, and, most of all, my
liberty.</p>

<p class='c007'>I took passage in a Genoese brig, commanded by
Captain Ventura, a man of such a character that he
had risen superior to the principles inculcated in Italian
youth by their priestly instructors. From him I
received the most gentlemanly treatment on my passage
to Guassu. There I embarked for Montevideo in
a balandra, commanded by Pascuale Corbona, who
likewise treated me with great kindness. Good fortune
and misfortune thus often succeeded each other.</p>

<h3 class='c001'><span class='xlarge'><b>CHAPTER VI.</b></span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>AT MONTEVIDEO—INCOGNITO—DEPARTURE FOR RIO
GRANDE—MARCH WITH THE ARMY OF THE PRESIDENT, BENTO
GONZALEZ—HIS CHARACTER, FAMILY, AND FRIENDS—AGREEABLE
 SOCIETY.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>In Montevideo I found a collection of my friends,
among whom the chief were Rosetti, Cuneo, and Castellani.
The first was on his return from a journey to
Rio Grande, where he had been received with the
greatest favor by the proud Republicans inhabiting
that region. In Montevideo I found myself still under
proscription, on account of my affair with the launches
of that state, and was obliged to remain in concealment
in the house of my friend Pepante, where I spent
a month. My retirement was relieved and enlightened
by the company of many Italian acquaintances,
who, at that time, when Montevideo was not suffering
from the calamities it has too often known, and, as is
always the case in time of peace, were distinguished by
a refinement and hospitality worthy of all praise. The
war, and chiefly the late siege, have since embittered
the lives of those good-hearted men, and produced
great changes in their condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the expiration of a month, I set off for Rio
Grande with Rosetti, on horseback; and that first
<a id='Page_39'></a>long journey I ever made in that manner I highly enjoyed.
On reaching Piratimin, we were cordially received
by the Governor of the Republic; and the Minister
of War, Almeida, treated us with great honor.
The President, Bento Gonzalez, had marched at the
head of a brigade to fight Silva Tavares, an imperial
chief, who was infesting that part of the province.
Piratimin, then the seat of the Republican government,
is a small village, but a peaceful place, in a rural
situation, and the chief town of the department of
that name. It is surrounded by a warlike people,
much devoted to the republic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being unoccupied in Piratimin, I requested permission
to join the column of operations under S. Gonzalez,
near the President, and it was granted. I was
introduced to Bento Gonzalez, and well received;
spent some time in his company, and thought him a
man highly favored by nature with some desirable
gifts. But fortune has been almost always favorable
to the Brazilian Empire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bento Gonzalez was a specimen of a magnanimous
soldier, though he was at that time nearly sixty years of
age. Being tall and active, he rode a fiery horse with
all the ease and dexterity of his young countrymen.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Camarino, where we had our arsenal, and whence
the Republican flotilla went out, resided the families
of Bento Gonzalez; and his brothers and numerous
relations inhabited most of the extensive tracts of
country lying along both sides of the river. And on
<a id='Page_40'></a>these beautiful pastures were fed immense herds of
cattle, which had been left undisturbed by the war,
because they were out of the reach of the troops. The
products of agriculture were very abundant; and surely
nowhere, in any country on earth, is found more kind
and cordial hospitality than among the inhabitants of
that part of the Province of Rio Grande. In their houses,
in which the beneficent character of the patriarchal
system is everywhere perceived in every family,
and where the greatest sympathy prevails, in consequence
of a general uniformity of opinions, I and my
band were received with the warmest welcome. The
estancias, to which we chiefly resorted, on account of
their proximity to the Lagoon, as well as for the
conveniences which it offered us, and the kind reception
which always awaited us, were those of Donna Antonia
and Donna Anna, sisters of Bento Gonzalez. The former
was situated on the Camones, and the latter on the
Arroyo Grande.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether I was under the influence of my imagination,
which at that early age may have been peculiarly
sensitive, and inclined me, with my little knowledge of
the world, to receive strong impressions from every
thing agreeable, or whatever else may have affected
me, there is no part of my life on which I look back
with greater pleasure, as a period of enjoyment, than
that which I spent in that most agreeable society of
sincere friends. In the house of Donna Anna, especially,
I took peculiar interest. That lady was advanced
<a id='Page_41'></a>in years, but possessed a most amiable disposition, and
was a very attractive acquaintance. She had with her
a family which had migrated from Pilotos, the head of
which was Don Paolo Ferreira. Three young ladies,
all of them agreeable, formed the ornaments of that
happy home. One of these, named Manuela, I most
highly admired, regarding her with that pleasure
which is natural to a young man, who goes into the
world with such a pure and exalted estimate of female
excellence as I had imbibed from my mother, and
who, after enduring great reverses, meets the sympathy
of such a person in a remote land of exile. Signora
Manuela, as I well knew, was betrothed to a son of
the President. In a scene of danger that young lover
displayed his attachment to her, in a manner which
convinced me of the sincerity of the love which he
professed; and I witnessed it with as much satisfaction
as if I had been her brother. I thenceforth regarded
the President's son as worthy of Manuela, and rejoiced
in the conviction that her happiness was in no danger,
in being entrusted to such faithful hands. The people
of that district are distinguished for beauty; and even
the slaves seem to partake of the same characteristic.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be supposed that an occasional contrary
wind, a storm, or an expedition, whatever else it might
produce, if it threw our vessel on that friendly shore
long enough to allow opportunity to visit their friendly
inhabitants, was not altogether disagreeable. Such an
<a id='Page_42'></a>occasion was always a festival. The Grove of Teviva,
(a kind of palm growing on the Arroyo Grande,)
which was the landmark for the entrance of the stream,
was always discovered with lively pleasure, and saluted
with redoubled enthusiasm and the loudest acclamations.
When the gentle hosts, to whose kindness we
felt so much indebted, wished to go to Camacuan to
visit Don Antonio and his amiable family, I seized the
opportunity with great pleasure, as it afforded me a
way to make some return for the many kindnesses
they had shown us, while it gave new occasions for
the display of their amiable character and refined and
pleasing manners, amidst the varying scenes of the
little voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between Arroyo Grande and Camacuan are several
sand-banks, called Tuntal, which extend from the west
shore of the Lagoon, almost at right angles and nearly
across, touching the opposite side, except only the narrow
space occupied by the boat channel, called Dos
Barcos. To go round these bars would greatly prolong
the time necessary for the voyage: but that might
be avoided, with some trouble. By throwing themselves
into the water and pushing the launches along
by main force, with their shoulders, the men could get
them over the bars, and then keep along the western
side of the Lagoon. This expedient was almost
always adopted by us, and especially on the occasions
referred to, when the boats were honored with the
presence of our welcome guests—that precious freight!
<a id='Page_43'></a>Whatever might be the wind, I was usually sure of
getting the launches over the bars; and, so accustomed
were my men to the task, and so prompt in the performance
of that laborious service, that the order to take to the
water ["<i>Al aqua, Tatos!</i>"] was scarcely pronounced
before they were overboard and at their posts.
And so, on all occasions, the task was performed with
alacrity and success, as if the crews had been engaged
in some favorite amusement on a day of jubilee, whatever
might be the hour or the weather. But when
pursued by the enemy in superior force, and suffering
in a storm, we were obliged to pass that way, sometimes
in the water a whole night, and without protection
from the waves, which would break over us, while
the temperature of the Lagoon was cooled by the rain,
and we were far from land, the exposure, the labor and
the sufferings were sometimes very great, and all the
fervor of youth was necessary to enable us to endure
them.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>AT THE GALPON OF CHARGINADA, REPAIRING THE
LAUNCHES—MY FRIEND, JOHN GRIGGS—A SURPRISE—A
BATTLE—RESULTS—TRIBUTE TO A FAIR FRIEND.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>After the capture of the Sumaca, the imperial
merchant vessels no longer set sail without a convoy,
but were always accompanied by vessels of war; and
it became a difficult thing to capture them. The expeditions
of the launches were, therefore, limited to a
few cruises in the Lagoon, and with little success, as
we were watched by the Imperialists, both by land
and by water. In a surprise made by the chief, Francisco
de Abrea, the whole of my band was near being
cut off with its leader.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were at the mouth of the Camacua, with the
launches drawn up on land, opposite the Galpon of
Charginada,—that is, the magazine or depôt of the
estancia, or large estate of that name. We were
engaged in salting meat and collecting Yerba Matté, a
species of tea, which grows in those parts of South
America, and is used as their daily beverage by the
inhabitants. The estate belonged to Donna Antonia,
sister of the President. In consequence of the war,
<a id='Page_45'></a>meat was not then salted there; and the Galpon was
occupied only with Yerba Matté. We used the spacious
establishment as our arsenal, and had drawn up our
launches some distance from the water, between the
magazine and the bank of the river, in order to repair
them. At that spot were the shops of the smiths and
laborers of the establishment, and there was a plentiful
supply of charcoal; for although not then in use,
the place retained something of its former condition
and appearance. There were not wanting pieces of
iron and steel, fit for different purposes in our little
vessels. We could easily visit the distant estancias
by a galloping ride, where we were most cheerfully
supplied with whatever we found deficient in the arsenal.</p>

<p class='c007'>With courage, cheerfulness, and perseverance, no
enterprise is impossible; and, for these I must do
justice to my favorite companion and usual forerunner,
John Griggs, who surmounted numerous difficulties,
and patiently endured many disappointments, in the
work of building two new launches.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a young man of excellent disposition, unquestionable
courage, and inexhaustible perseverance.
Though he belonged to a rich family, he had devoted
himself disinterestedly to the young Republic; and,
when letters from his friends in North America invited
him to return home, and offered him a very large
capital, he refused, and remained until he sacrificed
his life for an unhappy, but brave and generous, people.
<a id='Page_46'></a>I had afterwards to contemplate the sad and impressive
spectacle, presented by his death, when the body
of my friend was suddenly cut down by my side.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the launches were lying drawn up, as before
mentioned, and the repairs were busily going on, some
of the sailors were engaged with the sails, and some at
other occupations, near them, while several were employed
in making charcoal, or keeping watch as sentinels,
every one being busy about something,—by some
unexpected chance, Francisco de Albera, commonly
called Moringue, determined to surprise us; and,
although he did not succeed in his design, he gave us
not a little trouble. A surprise certainly was effected
on that occasion, and in a masterly manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had been on patrols all night, and all the men
had been, a short time before, assembled in the Galpon,
where the arms were loaded and deposited. It was a
beautiful morning, though cloudy; and nothing seemed
to be stirring, but all around was silent and apparently
lonely. Observations, however, were made around the
camp, with the greatest care, without discovering a
trace of anything new. About nine o'clock, most of
the people were set at work, in cutting wood; and for
this purpose were scattered about at considerable distances.
I had then about fifty men for the two
launches; and it happened that day, by a singular
concurrence of circumstances, our wants being peculiar,
that only a very few remained near the boats. I was
sitting by the fire, where breakfast was cooking, and
<a id='Page_47'></a>was just then taking some Matté. Near by was the
cook, and no other person.</p>

<p class='c007'>All on a sudden, and as if just over my head, I
heard a tremendous volley of firearms, accompanied
by a yell, and saw a company of the enemy's horsemen
marching on. I had hardly time to rise and take my
stand at the door of the Galpon, for at that instant
one of the enemy's lances made a hole through my
poncho. It was our good fortune to have our arms
all loaded, as I have before mentioned, and placed in
the Galpon, in consequence of our having been in a
state of alarm all night. They were placed inside of
the building, against the wall, ready and convenient
for use. I immediately began to seize the muskets
and discharge them in turn, and shot down many of
the enemy. Ignacio Bilbao, a brave Biscayan, and
Lorenzo N., a courageous Genoese, were at my side in
a moment; and then Eduardo Mutru, a native of the
country, Rafaele and Procopio, one a mulatto and the
other a black, and Francisco. I wish I could remember
the names of all my bold companions, who, to
the number of thirteen, assembled around me, and
fought a hundred and fifty enemies, from nine in the
morning until three in the afternoon, killing and
wounding many of them, and finally forcing them to
retreat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among our assailants were eighty Germans, in the
infantry, who were accustomed to accompany Maringue
in such expeditions, and were skilful soldiers,
<a id='Page_48'></a>both on foot and on horseback. When they had
reached the spot, they had dismounted and surrounded
the house, taking advantage of the ground, and of
some rough places, from which they poured upon us
a terrible fire from different sides. But, as often
happens in surprises, by not completing their operations
and closing, men ordinarily act as they please.
If, instead of taking positions, the enemy had advanced
upon the Galpon, and attacked us resolutely,
we should have been entirely lost, without the power
to resist their first attack. And we were more exposed
than we might ordinarily have been in any other
building, because, to allow the frequent passage of
carts, the sides of the magazine were left open.</p>

<p class='c007'>In vain did they attempt to press us more closely,
and assemble against the end walls. In vain did they
get upon the roofs, break them up and throw upon
our heads the fragments and burning thatch. They
were driven away by our muskets and lances.
Through loop-holes, which I made through the walls,
many were killed and many wounded. Then, pretending
to be a numerous body in the building, we sang
the republican hymn of Rio Grande, raising our voices
as loud as possible, and appeared at the doors,
flourishing our lances, and by every device endeavoring
to make our numbers appear multiplied.</p>

<p class='c007'>About three o'clock in the afternoon the enemy
retired, having many wounded, among whom was
their chief. They left six dead near the Galpon, and
<a id='Page_49'></a>several others at some distance. We had eight
wounded, out of fourteen. Rosetti, and our other
comrades, who were separated from us, had not been
able to join us. Some of them were obliged to cross
the river by swimming; others ran into the forest;
and one only, found by the enemy, was killed. That
battle, with so many dangers, and with so brilliant a
result, gave much confidence to our troops, and to the
inhabitants of that coast, who had been for a long
time exposed to the inroads of that adroit and enterprising
enemy, Maringue.</p>

<p class='c007'>We celebrated the victory, rejoicing at our deliverance
from a tempest of no small severity. At an
estancia, twelve miles distant, when the news of the
engagement was received, a young lady inquired, with
a pallid cheek and evident anxiety, whether Garibaldi
was alive. When I was informed of this, I rejoiced
at it more than at the victory itself. Yes! Beautiful
daughter of America! (for she was a native of the
Province of Rio Grande,) I was proud and happy to
enjoy your friendship, though the destined bride of
another. Fate reserved for me another Brazilian
female—to me the only one in the world whom I now
lament, and for whom I shall weep all my days. She
knew me when I was in misfortune; and her interest
in me, stronger than any merit of my own, conquered
her for me, and united us for ever.</p>

ENEMY COMMAND THE LAKE—PLAN TO ENTER IT—TRANSPORTATION
OF LAUNCHES OVER LAND—RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT
—BREAKERS—SHIPWRECK—SAD CATASTROPHE.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>The Lake or Lagoon Dos Patos is about 45 leagues in
length, or 135 miles, and from eleven to twenty miles
in medium width. Near its mouth, on the right shore,
stands a strong place, called Southern Rio Grande,
while Northern Rio Grande is on the opposite side.
Both are fortified towns, and were then in possession
of the Imperialists, as well as Porto Alegre.
The enemy were therefore masters of the lake by water.
It was thought impossible for the Republicans to pass
through the outlet which leads from the lake to the
sea, and as that was the only water passage, we were
obliged to prepare to effect a way of communication
by land. This could be done only by transporting the
launches on carts over the intermediate country. In
the northern part of the lake is a deep bay, called
Cassibani, which takes its name from a small river
that empties in at its further side. That bay was
chosen as the place for landing the launches; and the
operation was performed on the right bank. An
<a id='Page_51'></a>inhabitant of that part of the province, named De Abrea,
had prepared wheels of great solidity, connected two
and two by axles, proportioned to the weight of the
vessels. About two hundred domestic oxen were
then collected, with the assistance of the neighboring
inhabitants, and, by their labor, the launches were
drawn to the shore and got into the water, being
carried on wheels, placed at proportionate distances
from each other. Care, however, was taken to keep
them in such positions that the centre of gravity
should be preserved, by supporting the vessels laterally,
without disturbing the free action of the wheels.
Very strong ropes were, of course, provided, to attach
the oxen to the wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the vessels of the Republican squadron started
off, navigating across the fields. The oxen worked
well, they being well placed and prepared for drawing
freely in the most convenient manner. They travelled
a distance of fifty-four miles without any difficulty,
presenting a curious and unprecedented spectacle in
those regions. On the shore of Lake Tramandai the
launches were taken from the carts and put into the
water, and then loaded with necessaries and rigged for
sailing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lake Tramandai, which is formed by the streams
falling from the chain of Espenasso, empties into the
Atlantic, but is very shallow, having only about four
feet of water at high tide; besides, on that coast,
which is very open and all alluvial, the sea is never
<a id='Page_52'></a>tranquil, even in the most favorable weather: but the
numerous breakers incessantly stun the ear, and from
a distance of many miles their roar sounds like peals
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being ready to sail, we awaited the hour of the tide
and then ventured out, about four o'clock in the afternoon.
In those circumstances, practical skill in guiding
vessels among breakers was of great value, and
without it it is hard to say how we could ever have
succeeded in getting through them, for the propitious
hour of the tide was passed, and the water was not
deep enough. However, notwithstanding this, at the
beginning of the night our exertions were crowned
with entire success, and we cast anchor in the open
sea, outside of the furious breakers. It should be
known here, and borne in mind, that no vessel of any
kind had ever before passed out from the mouth of the
Tramandai. At about eight in the evening we departed
from that place, and at three in the afternoon
of the following day were wrecked at the mouth of the
Arevingua, with the loss of sixteen of the company in
the Atlantic, and with the destruction of the launch
Rio Pardo, which was under my command, in the
terrible breakers of that coast. The particulars of
that sad disaster were as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in the evening the wind threatened from the
south, preparing for a storm, and beginning to blow
with violence. We followed the coast. The launch
Rio Pardo, with thirty men on board, a twelve
<a id='Page_53'></a>pounder on a pivot, and some extra rigging, taken for
precaution, as I was unacquainted with that navigation,
seemed strong and well-prepared for us to sail
towards the enemy's country. But our vessels lay
deep in the water, and sometimes sank so low into the
sea, that they were in danger of foundering. They
would occasionally remain several minutes under the
waves. I determined to approach the land and find
out where we were; but, the winds and waves increasing,
we had no choice, and were compelled to stand off
again, and were soon involved in the frightful breakers.
I was at that moment on the top of the mast, hoping
to discover some point of the coast less dangerous to
approach. By a sudden turn the vessel was rolled
violently to starboard, and I was thrown some distance
overboard. Although in such a perilous situation,
I did not even think of death; but, knowing I had
many companions who were not seamen and were suffering
from sea sickness, I endeavored to collect as
many oars and other buoyant objects as possible, and
brought them near the vessel, advising each man to
take one to assist him in reaching the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first one who came near to me, holding to a
shroud, was Eduardo Mutru; and to him I gave a
dead-light, recommending to him not to let go of it on
any account. Carniglia, the courageous man who was
at the helm at the moment of the catastrophe, remained
confined to the vessel on the windward side, being
held down in such a manner, by a Calmuc jacket
<a id='Page_54'></a>which confined his limbs, that he could not free himself.
He made me a sign that he wanted my assistance,
and I sprang forward to relieve my dear friend.
I had in the pocket of my trowsers a small knife with
a handle; this I took, and with all the strength I was
master of, began to cut the collar, which was made of
velvet. I had just divided it when the miserable
instrument broke,—a surge came over us, and sunk the
vessel and all that it contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>I struck the bottom of the sea, like a shot; and the
waters, which washed violently around me like whirlpools,
half-suffocated me. I rose again: but my unfortunate
friend was gone for ever! A portion of the
crew I found dispersed, and making every exertion to
gain the coast by swimming. I succeeded among the
first; and the next thing, after setting my feet upon
the land, was to turn and discover the situation of my
comrades. Eduardo appeared, at a short distance.
He had left the dead-light which I had given him, or,
as is more probable, the violence of the waves had torn
it from his grasp, and was struggling alone, with an
appearance that indicated that he was reduced to an
extremity. I loved Eduardo like a brother, and was
affected beyond measure at his condition. Ah! I was
sensitive in those days! My heart had never been
hardened; and I was generous. I rushed towards my
dear friend, reaching out to him the piece of wood
which had saved me on my way to the shore. I had
got very near him; and, excited by the importance of
<a id='Page_55'></a>the undertaking, should, have saved him: but a surge
rolled over us both; and I was under water for a moment.
I rallied, and called out, not seeing him appear;
I called in desperation,—but in vain. The friend dear
to my heart was sunk in the waves of that ocean
which he had not feared, in his desire to join with me
in serving the cause of mankind. Another martyr to
Italian liberty, without a stone, in a foreign land!</p>

<p class='c007'>The bodies of sixteen of my companions, drowned
in the sea, were transported a distance of thirty miles,
to the northern coast, and buried in its immense sands.
Several of the remainder were brought to land. There
were seven Italians. I can mention Luigi Carniglia,
Eduardo Mutru, Luigi Stadirini, Giovanni D.,—but
three other names I do not remember. Some were
good swimmers. In vain I looked among those who
were saved, to discover any Italian faces. All my
countrymen were dead. My feelings overpowered me.
The world appeared to me like a desert. Many of the
company who were neither seamen nor swimmers were
saved.</p>

<p class='c007'>I found a barrel of brandy, which I thought a valuable
acquisition, and told Manuel Rodriguez to open
it, and give some to each of the survivors, to invigorate
them. Efforts were made to open the cask:
but, fatigued as we all were, much time was spent in
performing the task; and, in the mean time, the men
became so much chilled, that they might have perished,
if the thought had not occurred to me to set them all
<a id='Page_56'></a>running, in order to restore their strength by keeping
their blood in circulation. "Come, let us run!" I said
to them; and then, starting off myself and running as
fast as I could towards the north, they would follow
me, until unable to go further. I repeated this until I
thought they no longer required exercise; and am sure
that my own life, at least, was saved by the expedient,—for
without the effort, I must have fallen a victim to
fatigue and cold. Thus running along the shore, we
encouraged each other, to go further and further. It
made a bend, at some distance; and on the inner side
is the Arasingua, which runs almost parallel with the
sea at that place, to its mouth, half a mile distant.
We then followed the right bank; and, after going
about four miles, found an inhabited house, where we
were received with the greatest hospitality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Seival, our other launch, commanded by Griggs,
being of a different construction from the Rio Pardo,
was better able to sustain itself, although but little
larger, against the violence of the storm, and had held
on her course.</p>

<p class='c006'>That part of the Province of St. Catharine where we had
been shipwrecked, fortunately had risen in insurrection
against the empire on receiving the news of the approach
of the Republican forces; and therefore
we were well received, found friends, were feasted,
and at once obtained everything necessary, at least
everything which those good people had to offer. We
were soon furnished with what we needed to enable
us to join the vanguard of Canabarro, commanded by
Colonel Terceira, which was setting off on a rapid
march, to surprise Laguna. And, indeed, the enterprise
was very successful. The garrison of that little
city, consisting of about four hundred men, took up a
forced march in retreat; and three small vessels of war
surrendered after a short resistance. I went with my
shipwrecked sailors on board the sloop Itaparica, which
had seven guns. Fortune smiled so much on the Republicans
in those first days of the revolution, that it
<a id='Page_58'></a>seemed as if Providence was pleased to grant us success.
The Imperialists, not knowing and not believing
that such an expedition could be sent so suddenly
to Laguna, but having information that an invasion
was meditated by us, had a supply of arms and ammunition
then on the way, which, with soldiers and everything,
fell into our hands. The inhabitants received
us like brothers and liberators: a character which we
well merited, and which we sustained during our stay
among those very kind and good people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Canabarro, having fixed his head-quarters in the city
of Laguna, called by the Republicans Villa Juliana,
(because our entrance was made in July,) promised to
establish a Provincial Representative Government, the
first president of which was a reverend priest, who had
great influence among the people. Rosetti, with the
title of Secretary of the Government, was in fact the
soul of it. And Rosetti, in truth, was formed for
such a station.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that time occurred one of the most important
events of my life. I had never thought of matrimony,
but had considered myself incapable of it from being
of too independent a disposition, and too much inclined
to adventure. To have a wife and children
appeared to me decidedly repulsive, as I had devoted
my whole life to one principle, which, however good it
might be, could not leave me the quietness necessary to
the father of a family. But my destiny guided me in a
different direction from what I had designed for myself.
<a id='Page_59'></a>By the loss of Luigi Carniglia, Eduardo and
my other comrades, I was left in a state of complete
isolation, and felt as if alone in the world. Not one
of those friends of my heart remained. I felt the
greatest possible need of them. All the friends I now
had were new ones: good, it is true, but not one of
them really an intimate one. And this change had
been made so unexpectedly, and in so terrible a manner,
that it was impossible to overcome the impressions it
had made upon my feelings. I felt the want of some
one to love me, and a desire that such a one might be
very soon supplied, as my present state of mind seemed
insupportable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosetti was a brother to me: but he could not live
with me, and I could see him but rarely. I desired a
friend of a different character; for, although still
young, I had considerable knowledge of men, and
knew enough to understand what was necessary for
me in a true friend. One of the other sex, I thought
must supply the vacant place, for I had always regarded
woman as the most perfect of creatures, and
believe it far easier to find a loving heart among that
sex.</p>

<p class='c007'>I walked the deck of the Itaparica, with my mind
revolving these things, and finally came to the conclusion
to seek for some lady possessing the character
which I desired. I one day cast a casual glance at
a house in the Burra, (the eastern part of the entrance
of the Jayuna,) and there observed a young female
<a id='Page_60'></a>whose appearance struck me as having something
very extraordinary. So powerful was the impression
made upon me at the moment, though from some cause
which I was not able fully to ascertain, that I gave
orders and was transported towards the house. But
then I knew of no one to whom I could apply for an
introduction. I soon, however, met with a person, an
inhabitant of the town, who had been acquainted with
me from the time of arrival. I soon received an invitation
to take coffee with his family, and the first person
who entered was the lady whose appearance had
so mysteriously but irresistibly drawn me to the place.
I saluted her; we were soon acquainted; and I found
that the hidden treasure which I had discovered was
of rare and inestimable worth. But I have since reproached
myself for removing her from her peaceful
native retirement to scenes of danger, toil and suffering.
I felt most deeply self-reproach on that day when,
at the mouth of the Po, having landed, in our retreat
from an Austrian squadron, while still hoping to restore
her to life, on taking her pulse I found her a
corpse, and sang the hymn of despair. I prayed for
forgiveness, for I thought of the sin of taking her
from her home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little or nothing of importance, after this, took
place in the Lagoon. The building of our launches
was commenced; and the materials were obtained
from the remains of the prizes, and by the assistance
of the neighboring inhabitants, who were always
<a id='Page_61'></a>friendly, and forward in aiding me. Two launches
having been completed and armed, the band were
called to Itaparica, to coöperate with the army, then
besieging the capital of the province, Porto Allegre.
The army accomplished nothing; and the band were
unable to effect anything all the time they spent in
that part of the Laguna. An expedition was contemplated
in the province of St. Catherine; I was called
to join it, and General Canabarro was to accompany me.
The two smaller launches remained in the lake, under
the command of Zefferino d'Ubrea; and I went with
two others, with the division of Canabarro, which was
to appear by land, while I was to approach by water.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was accompanied by my inseparable friend, John
Griggs, and had with me a chosen part of my band,
who had assisted in building the launches.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three vessels which were armed, and destined
to make an excursion on the ocean, were the Rio
Pardo, which was under my command, and the Casapava,
under Griggs—both schooners—and lastly, the
Seival, which had come from Rio Grande, commanded
by the Italian, Lorenzo. The mouth of the Lagoon
was blockaded by Imperial vessels of war; but we
went out by night, without falling in with any of them,
and steered north. When we had reached the latitude
of Santos, we met an Imperial corvette, which chased
us two days in vain,—when we approached the Island
of Abrigo, where we captured two Sumacas. This is
a kind of vessel, so named by the Brazilians, being a
<a id='Page_62'></a>sort of sloop. We then proceeded on the cruise, and
took several other prizes. After eight days' sailing
we returned towards the Lagoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had conceived a singular presentiment of the state
of things in that region, because, before my departure,
the people of St. Catherine's had begun to show a
bad humor, and it was known that a strong corps of
troops was approaching, commanded by General
Andrea, who was famous for precipitation, and his
atrocious system of warfare, which made him much
feared. When off St. Catherine's, on our return, we
met a Brazilian patachio, which is a sort of brig-schooner,—the
Rio Pardo and the Seival being together,
the Casapava having parted company a few
nights before, when it was very dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were discovered; and there was no escape.
We therefore attacked them, and opening a fire. The
enemy replied bravely; but the action could produce
but little effect, because the sea was very rough. The
result, however, was the loss of several of our prizes,
the commanders of some of which, being frightened
by the superior force of the enemy, struck their flags,
while others steered for the neighboring coast. Only
one of the prizes was saved, that commanded by the
brave Ignacio Bilbao, which went ashore in the port
of Imbituba, and remained in our possession. The
Seival had her gun dismounted in the engagement, and
having sprung a leak, took the same direction, and I
was obliged to abandon the prizes.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_63'></a>We entered Imbituba with a northerly wind, which
changed to the south in the night, and thus rendered it
impossible to enter the Lagoon. It was to be presumed
that we would be attacked by the Imperial vessels
stationed at the island of St. Catherine's, because
information would be carried to them by that with
which we had the engagement. It was therefore
necessary to make preparations; and the Seival's dismounted
gun was placed on a promontory which forms
the bay on the eastern side, and a battery was formed
of gabions. At daylight three Imperial vessels were
discovered approaching. The Rio Pardo, which was
at anchor at the bottom of the bay, commenced the
action, which was rather a singular one, the Imperialists
being in incomparably superior force. The
enemy, being favored by the wind in manœuvring,
kept under sail, and gave a furious fire, from favorable
positions, all of them upon my one poor little schooner.
She, however, maintained the fight with resolution,
and at close quarters,—even carbines being used on
both sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the injuries done were in inverse proportion to
the forces of the two parties; for the Republican
vessel was soon strewn with dead bodies, while the
hull was riddled and the spars destroyed. We had
resolved to fight to the last; and this resolution was
increased by the Brazilian Amazon on board. My wife
not only refused to land, but took an active part in the
engagement. If the crew fought with resolution, they
<a id='Page_64'></a>received no little aid from the brave Manuel Rodriguez,
who commanded the battery, and kept up a
well-directed and effective fire. The enemy were very
determined, but operated chiefly against the schooner;
and I several times believed, as they came up, that
they were going to board us,—and was prepared for
everything, except to submit.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, after several hours spent in active fight,
the enemy retired, on account, as was said, of the
death of the commander of the Bella Americana, one of
their vessels. We spent the remainder of the day in
burying our dead and in repairing our greatest damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the following day the enemy remained at a
distance, and we made preparations for fighting, and
also for escape by sailing to the Lagoon, the wind being
then more favorable.</p>

MELLO—OUR DISASTER—RALLY.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>Changes were expected to take place at Laguna on
the approach of the enemy, who were very strong on
land; and little good-will shown by St. Catherine's
induced some of the towns to rise against the Republican
authority. Among these was the town of Jamaica,
a place situated at the extremity of the lake. Canabarro
gave me a peremptory charge to reduce it, and,
as a punishment, to sack it. The garrison had made
preparations for defence towards the water; but I
landed at the distance of three miles, and attacked
them unexpectedly from the mountains. The garrison
being discomfited and put to flight, the troops under
my command were soon in possession of the town. I
wish, for myself, and for every other person who has
not forgotten to be a man, to be exempt from the necessity
of witnessing the sack of a town. A long and
minute description would not be sufficient to give a
just idea of the baseness and wickedness of such a
deed. May God save me from such a spectacle
<a id='Page_66'></a>hereafter! I never spent a day of such wretchedness and
in such lamentation. I was filled with horror; and
the fatigue I endured in restraining personal violence
was excessive. As for preventing robbery, that was
impossible. A terrible state of disorder prevailed. The
authority of a commander availed nothing; nor could
all the exertions made by myself and a few officers control
their unbridled cupidity. It had no effect to
threaten them that the enemy would return to the
fight in much greater numbers, and if they should take
them by surprise, disbanded and intoxicated, would
make a sacrifice of them,—though that was true to the
letter. Nothing would prevent them from engaging
in a general scene of pillage. The town, though small,
unfortunately contained a vast quantity of spirits;
and drunkenness soon became general. The men who
were with me were new levies, whom I did not know,
and wholly undisciplined. I am sure that if even fifty
of the enemy had appeared, in those circumstances, we
should have been lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a long time, by threats, blows, and some
wounds, those wild beasts were marched out and embarked;
several pipes of spirits were shipped for the
division, and we returned to the Lagoon, while the
Republican vanguard was retiring before the enemy,
who were advancing with celerity, and very strong.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we reached the Lagoon, we took the baggage
across to the right shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>That day I had much to do; for, if the men were
<a id='Page_67'></a>not very numerous, there were many embarrassments,
and many horses to be taken care of. And besides,
the outlet of the Lagoon was narrow at the entrance,
the current was strong, and when this was not found,
the shores were not distant. I had to labor, therefore,
from morning until near noon, to get the division
over, and then stood near the bar to observe the enemy's
vessels, which were advancing in combination
with the land forces with a great number of troops on
board. Before ascending the mountain, I had already
sent information to the General that the enemy were preparing
to force the passage of the bar, having been
able to discover the enemy's vessels while I was effecting
the transport. Having reached the other side, I
satisfied myself of the fact. The enemy had twenty-two
vessels, all adapted to the entrance. I then repeated
the message; but either the General was doubtful,
or his men wanted to eat or to rest. The fact
was, that not a man arrived in time to assist in operating
at the point where our infantry had been posted,
and where we might have made great havoc with the
enemy. Resistance was made by the battery situated
on the eastern point, commanded by the brave Captain
Capotto; but, in consequence of the want of
practice on the part of the cannoniers, very little damage
was done. The same result was experienced by
the three vessels under my command, the crews of
which were very small, many of the men that day being
on land; and thus some would rest, and others
<a id='Page_68'></a>would not expose themselves to the tremendous battle
which was preparing. I was at my post in the Rio
Pardo; and my wife, the incomparable Anita, fired
the first shot, putting the match to the gun with her
own hand, and animating with her voice the timid
and the hesitating.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle was short, but a murderous one. Not
many were killed, because very few were on board;
but I was the only officer in the three vessels left alive.
All the enemy's squadron entered, making a tremendous
fire, favored by the wind and the current flowing
in, by which their velocity was much increased, and
anchored at the distance of a cannon-shot from our
vessels, still keeping up their cannonade. I asked
Canabarro for men to continue the battle; but received,
in answer, an order to destroy the vessels and
retire, with all the remainder that could be landed. I
had sent Anna with the message, directing her to remain
on shore; but she returned on board with the
answer, showing a coolness and courage which excited
my astonishment and highest admiration. To her
boldness and exertions was due the saving of the ammunition,
which was safely landed. When this was effected,
I remained alone on board, having yet to perform
the last act of setting the little flotilla on fire. The
enemy still continued their severe cannonade. I had
to contemplate a terrible spectacle on every vessel,
as I visited them all in succession, the decks being
strewn with the dead. Captain Enrique, of the
<a id='Page_69'></a>Taparica, from Laguna, was found shot through the breast
with a grape shot; Griggs, commander of the Cassapava,
had been cut in two by a shot, and his trunk
was standing against the bulwarks, his face retaining
its natural rubicund look, so that he seemed as if
living. A few moments afterwards their bodies were
sunk in the water: those victims of the empire were
lost to human sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Night came on, as I collected the survivors, and
marched behind the division, on the retreat for Rio
Grande, by the same road which they had trodden a
few months before, with their hearts filled with hope
and confident of victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the many sufferings of my stormy life, I
have not been without happy moments; and among
them, I count that in which, at the head of the few
men remaining to me after numerous conflicts, and
who had gained the character of bravery, I first
mounted, and commenced my march, with my wife at
my side, in a career which had always attractions for
me, even greater than that of the sea. It seemed to
me of little importance that my entire property was
that which I carried, and that I was in the service of
a poor republic, unable to pay anybody. I had a
sabre and a carbine, which I carried on the front of
my saddle. My wife was my treasure, and no less
fervent in the cause of the people than myself; and
she looked upon battles as an amusement, and the
inconveniences of a life in the field as a pastime.
<a id='Page_70'></a>Then, whatever might happen, I was looked upon
with smiles; and the more wild the extensive and
desert American plains appeared, the more beautiful
and delightful they seemed to our eyes. I thought
myself in the performance of my duty, in encountering
and overcoming the dangers to which I exposed
myself, as the object I had in view was the good of
men who needed my aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>We reached Las Torres, the boundary of the two
neighboring provinces, where we established our camp.
The enemy contented themselves with being masters
of the Lagoon, and did not proceed beyond. But, in
combination with the division of Andrea, the division
of Acunha advanced by the Serra, having recently
come from the province of St. Paul, and being on the
way for the Cima da Serra, (meaning the top of the
mountains,) a department belonging to Rio Grande.
The Serrans, overwhelmed by a superior force, asked
assistance of General Canabarro; and he arranged
an expedition for their aid, under the command of
General Terceira. I, with my companions, formed a
part of it; and, having joined the Serrans, who were
under Colonel Acunha, we completely beat that division
at Santa Victoria. The General was lost in the
river Pelotas, and the greater part of his troops were
made prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>That victory brought the three provinces of Lages,
Vaccaria, and Cima da Serra, under the republic; and, a
few days after, the conquerors entered Lages in triumph.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_71'></a>In the meantime the invasion by the Imperialists
had restored their party to power in the province of
Missiones; and Colonel Mello, the Imperial General,
had increased his corps in that province to about five
hundred men. General Bento Manuel, who was to
have fought him, was unable, because he had retreated;
and he contented himself with sending Lieutenant-Colonel
Portinhos in pursuit of Mello, who was marching
in the direction of San Pablo. The position in
which I was then placed gave us an opportunity not
only to oppose Mello, but also to exterminate his force.
But such was not the event.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Terceira being uncertain whether the enemy
would come by Vaccaria, or by the Caritibani,
divided his forces into two, sending Colonel Aranha,
with the good cavalry of the Serra, to Vaccaria, and
marching towards the Caritibani with the infantry,
and a part of the cavalry, chiefly composed of prisoners.
It was by that point that the enemy approached.
This division of the forces proved fatal. Their recent
victory, the ardent feelings of the corps, and the information
received concerning the enemy, which represented
their numbers and spirit as less than they
really were, led to their despising them too much.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a three days' march we reached Caritibani,
and went round by the pass of Maromba, by which it
was supposed the enemy would march. Guards
were placed in the Pass, and at other points, where
they were thought necessary. Towards midnight the
<a id='Page_72'></a>guards at the pass were attacked, and compelled to
retreat, so that they had scarcely time to escape after
firing a few shots. From that moment until the
break of day, the Republican troops stood ready for
action; and it was not long after that hour that the
enemy appeared, having crossed the river with their
whole force, and drawn up near it ready for action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any other officer than Terceira, on seeing their
superiority, would have hastened to effect a junction
with the column of Aranha, and would have occupied
the enemy until he could have accomplished it. But
the ardent Republican feared that the enemy might
escape him, and deprive him of an opportunity to fight.
He therefore pressed on to the encounter, although the
enemy were in an advantageous position. Of that
position they took advantage, having formed their line
of battle on a hill of considerable height, opposite
which was a very deep valley, obstructed with thick
bushes. I had covered our flanks with several platoons
of cavalry, which they did not see. Terceira
ordered to attack, with a band of infantry, taking
advantage of the obstacles in the valley. The attack
was made, and the enemy made a feint of retreating;
but, while the whole Republican body, after passing
the valley, was pursuing the enemy under the hill,
within musket-shot, it was charged in flank by a
squadron which had been concealed on the right flank
of the enemy, obliged to retreat in disorder, and to
concentrate anew. In that encounter fell one of the
<a id='Page_73'></a>bravest of my officers, Manuel N., who was very dear
to me. The troops, being now reinforced, and sent
forward with greater impetus and resolution, the enemy
finally retired, and took up their retreat, leaving one
of their men dead on the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were not many wounded on either side, for
very few had taken part in the action. The enemy,
however, retreated precipitately, and the Republicans
pursued them to Aube; but the infantry were not able
to overtake them in nine miles, although they did their
utmost to accelerate their march. In the vicinity of
the Pass of Maromba, the commander of the Republican
vanguard, Major Jacinto, informed the Colonel
that the enemy were crossing the Ganado and the
Cavaladas,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> with indications that they would continue
their retreat and not recover from their panic. The
brave Terceira did not hesitate for a moment, but
ordered the cavalry to proceed on the gallop, and
directed me to follow with the infantry as fast as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The watchful enemy, however, had only manœuvred
to deceive us, and by the precipitation of their march
had got in an advantageous position of which we were
not aware, concealed by the ground. One of our platoons
had been placed far in advance, and two others
<a id='Page_74'></a>near it, but the infantry imprudently left far behind.
The enemy suddenly extended their right and made his
appearance on our left, running out from a valley which
had a small declivity. They bore down upon the Republican
platoon with their lances, and gave them this
first notice of their error, which there was not time to
repair. Attacked in flank, they were completely discomfited.
The other platoons of cavalry shared the
same fate, notwithstanding the courage and efforts
of Terceira and several brave Rio Grande officers.
Being taken in detail, they opposed little resistance;
and in a short time all were scattered, flying and completely
broken. To be so far with the infantry was
very painful to me, and the more so because the
materials of which it was composed were not good, the
greater part being men who had been prisoners in
Santa Victoria. I therefore hastened on the infantry
as fast as possible to join in the fight, but in vain.
Having reached an elevation, I witnessed the slaughter
of my friends, and knew there was no time to do anything
to turn the tide, and therefore resolved to save
as many as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>I called to about a dozen of my old companions,
whom I saw and recognized; and, on hearing my voice,
they hastened towards me. I left an officer, to remain
in charge of the body of infantry (Major Peixotto,)
and then, with that small band, I took a position,
partly sheltered by a few bushes, on an elevated spot
of ground. There we began to make a stand against
<a id='Page_75'></a>the enemy, and to teach them that they were not victorious
everywhere. In an attack upon us, several
companies of cavalry were repulsed, although they
made great efforts and displayed much courage. The
infantry at last joined us in our position, and then the
defence became powerful, and to the enemy terrible
and murderous.</p>

RETREAT—PREPARATION—COMMENCEMENT—PROGRESS—RESULT
—ARRIVAL AT THE TOWN OF LAGES.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>In the meantime, strong in my position, and having
now a band of seventy-three, I fought the enemy with
advantage. As the Imperialists were destitute of infantry,
they had little desire to engage with troops of
that arm. Notwithstanding the advantageous ground
possessed by us, however, it was necessary to seek a
more secure cover, to prevent the victorious enemy
from bringing together all their forces, and to avoid
giving time for the courage of the defenders to cool.
I observed a cappon, or island of trees, which was in
sight, at about the distance of a mile, and undertook
a retreat in that direction. The enemy manœuvred
to interrupt us, and every few moments charged with
the advantage of the ground. In such circumstances
it proved highly important that my officers were armed
with carbines; and, as they were all good soldiers,
they repelled the enemy's charges with unshaken firmness.
Thus the remains of our conquered party reached
the cappon, where the enemy offered us no further
molestation; while we penetrated a little distance into
<a id='Page_77'></a>the wood, chose a cleared spot, and collecting together,
with our arms ready, waited for night. The enemy
were heard calling out to us "Surrender! Surrender!"
We kept silence and returned no answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Night at length came on; and I made preparations
for departure. A few wounded men, who were of our
number, presented the greatest difficulty. Among them
was Major Peixotto, who had received a ball in his
foot. Near ten o'clock in the evening, when the wounded
had been accommodated in the best manner possible,
the march was commenced, by proceeding along
the skirts of the cappon, which we left on the right,
endeavoring to find the borders of the Matto, or forest.
That forest, perhaps the largest in the world, extends
from the alluvial regions of the Plata to those of
the Amazon, crowning the crest of the Serra de Espinasso,
which forms the backbone of Brazil, over an extent
of thirty-four degrees of latitude. The number
of degrees of longitude which it embraces we are unable
to give. In the midst of that immense wilderness
are situated the three departments of Cima da Serra,
Vaccaria and Lages, which are surrounded by the forests.
The scene of our dangerous operations was now
Caritibani, in the last named department, a place which
derived its name from Caritiba, a place in the province
of Santa Caterina, (St. Catharine,) from which the inhabitants
came.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to reach the forest, the troops moved along
the side of the <i>cappon</i>, intending to take the course
<a id='Page_78'></a>towards Lages, to find the corps of Aranha, from
which they were unfortunately separated. One of
those things occurred on their issuing from the wood,
which prove how far man is the child of circumstances,
and what effect may be produced by a panic, even on
the most intrepid soldiers. The Republicans were
marching in silence; and, as may be supposed, prepared
for action, in case the enemy should appear in an
attitude of opposing them. A horse, which happened
to be in that part of the wood, on hearing the little
noise made by the cautious soldiers in their march, took
to flight, and ran away. One voice was heard to exclaim:
"The enemy!" and, in a moment, all those seventy-three
men, who had so lately most valiantly fought
five hundred, rushed at once into the thickest of the
forest; and, so far did they become separated and scattered,
in that moment of fear, that it would have taken
many hours to collect them again; and, as it was impossible
for us to wait long enough, several were left
behind and lost. The others pursued their way with
me; and when daybreak appeared, we found ourselves
on the long wished-for border of the forest, and issuing
in the direction of Lages. The next day the enemy
approached, but did not reach us. The day of battle
was terrible, for its labors, dangers and troubles;
but we fought, and that idea overpowered every other;
but in the forest, where meat, the accustomed food,
was in fact wanting, and where no other kind could
be obtained, we remained four days without finding
<a id='Page_79'></a>anything to eat except the roots of plants. The fatigue
we endured was indescribable, in following a retreat
where there were no paths, and where nature
incomparably prolific and robust, had reared up
colossal pines in the immense woods, and the gigantic
taquara, (a kind of cane,) which formed insuperable
barriers in many places. Many of the company
were discouraged, some deserted, and it was a great
task, first to collect them, and then to convince them
that it was better to accompany the corps than to desert
it, though they might absent themselves, if they
preferred it, as they should be free to do as they
pleased. This manner of proceeding with them proved
perfectly successful. From that moment there was no
more desertion; and the hope of safety began to arise
in the hearts of the troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the fifth day after the battle we reached the entrance
of the Piccada, (a narrow path cut through the
forest,) where we found a house and made a halt, killing
two oxen. We made two prisoners in the house,
who belonged to the enemy, and who had fought us.
We then continued our way to Lages, which we reached
after a day's march through the rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The town of Lages, which had made such rejoicing
on our arrival as conquerors, had changed its flag on
hearing of our disasters; and some of the boldest of
the inhabitants had established the imperial system.
On our approach they fled; and, as most of them were
merchants, numbers left their stores filled with everything
<a id='Page_80'></a>necessary to restore the needy soldiers; and thus
their condition was greatly improved. Terceira wrote
to Aranha, in the mean time, ordering him to concentrate
again; as he had notice at that time of the arrival
of Lieutenant Colonel Tartinho, who had been
sent by Bento Manuel in pursuit of the forces of Mello.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have served the cause of the people in America, and
served it with sincerity, as I everywhere fought against
absolutism. Being warmly attached to the system corresponding
with my convictions, I was equally opposed
in my feelings to the opposite system. I have always
rather pitied than hated men who have been led to
selfishness by misfortune; and, when now viewing the
scenes I passed through, from a far distant country,
and long after their occurrence, the accounts contained
in the succeeding pages may be regarded as impartial,
with the care which has been taken in recording facts,
reviewing occurrences, and making allowances for
men and circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be unhesitatingly asserted that "<i>The Sons
of the Continent</i>" (the name given to the people of Rio
Grande,) were most ardent and intrepid men. This
<a id='Page_82'></a>character I claim for them, after having had many opportunities
to form a correct opinion. The occupation
of Lages by our troops was therefore a very bold step,
with the intention of defending it against an enemy
ten times superior and victorious, and divided from
them only by the river Canoas, which could not be defended,
and far from any auxiliaries who might have
wished to aid the Republicans. Many days passed before
the junction of Aranha and Portinho; and, during
all that time, the enemy were kept at bay by a small
band of men. The reinforcements had no sooner arrived,
than the Republicans marched resolutely against
the enemy: but the Imperialists did not accept the
offer of a battle, but retired when we approached, making
a stand in the Province of San Paolo, where they
were to be joined by large reinforcements of infantry
and cavalry. The Republicans then felt the defect
and the evils of being composed chiefly of men brave
indeed, but who did not know the importance of keeping
their ranks, except when the enemy appeared, and
relaxed in discipline whenever they were either far
distant, or remained near without showing inclination
for a speedy battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>That fault was almost their ruin, and a more enterprising
enemy would have known how to take advantage
of it. The Serranos, (or people of the neighboring
mountains,) began to leave the files, and throw their
lazos, not only over their own horses, but over those
belonging to the division. Those of Portinho, (the
<a id='Page_83'></a>people of the Province of Missions,) followed their
example; and the force was soon so far reduced, that
they were obliged to abandon Lages, and retire to the
province of Rio Grande, fearing an attack from the
enemy. The rest of the forces, being thus weakened,
and in want of necessaries, especially clothing, which
was quite indispensable in consequence of the commencement
of cold weather so early in those elevated
regions, began to lose their spirits, and demanded, with
a loud voice, to return to their homes. Colonel
Terceira was then obliged to yield to so many necessities,
and ordered me to descend the Serra and rejoin
the army, while he prepared to follow me.</p>

<p class='c007'>That descent was arduous, in consequence of the
difficult roads, and the decided hostility of the inhabitants,
who were enemies of the Republicans. I proceeded
by the Piccada de Peluffo. The troops were
only about sixty in number, and they had to confront
terrible ambuscades; but such were their indomitable
boldness and perseverance, that they passed in safety.
Although the path was very narrow, and everywhere
overshadowed by a very thick forest, the enemy,
being natives of the country, and therefore perfectly
acquainted with every place, chose the most thorny
spots for their ambushes, rushed out with fury and
tremendous cries upon the Republican troops, who
in return poured in their volleys of musketry, and
used their sabres. At length, the vigor and perseverance
of the latter so far intimidated the mountaineers,
<a id='Page_84'></a>that they killed but one horse, and only
slightly wounded a few men.</p>

<p class='c007'>We arrived at the head-quarters, in Malacara, distant
twelve miles from Porto Allegre, where was the
President, Bento Gonzales, then General-in-chief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Republican army were preparing to march.
The enemy's army, after losing the battle of Rio Pardo,
had recruited in Porto Allegre, and gone out, under
command of the old general, Jorge, (George,) and
had encamped on the bank of the Cahi, waiting for
General Calderon to join him, who had left Rio
Grande with a strong body of cavalry and was to
effect a junction, by crossing the country. The same
defect which has been mentioned above,—that is, the
delusive security of the Republican troops when there
was no enemy in sight,—facilitated those movements of
the enemy: when General Netto, who commanded the
country troops, had collected force enough to fight
Calderon, the latter, having now joined the main
body of the Imperial army, at Cahi, which was threatening
the Republicans with superior numbers, while
besieging, compelled them to raise the siege. It was
indispensable to the President to join the division of
Netto, in order to be in a condition to fight the
enemy's army; and that junction, being happily
effected, greatly honored the military capacity of
Bento Gonzales. They marched with the army from
Malacara, taking the direction of San Leopoldo, passing
within two miles of the enemy's army; and in two
<a id='Page_85'></a>days and nights, almost without eating, arrived in the
neighborhood of Taguary, where they found General
Netto, who had come to meet them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The march had been made, as was just remarked,
almost without eating; and, as soon as the enemy had
notice of the movement, they set off, at forced marches,
to fight them. By rare fortune they overtook the
Republicans when they had halted, and were engaged
in cooking their meat,—the only food, as has been
remarked, which armies in that country ever have to
subsist upon. They were, therefore, obliged to desist,
and defer their meal until they could effect the junction
designed. They halted again at Pinheirino, six
miles from Taguary, and made all the arrangements
for a battle. The Republican army, consisting of
five thousand cavalry and one thousand infantry, occupied
the heights of Pinheirino; the infantry being
in the centre, under the command of the aged Colonel
Crescenzio; the right wing under General Netto; and
the left under General Canabarro. Both wings were
wholly composed of cavalry, which, without exaggeration,
was the best in the world, although ill-provided.
The infantry was excellent; and the desire for fighting
was strong and general. Colonel João Antonio commanded
the reserve, which was a corps of artillery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy had four thousand infantry, and, it was
said, three thousand cavalry, with a few pieces of
artillery. They had taken positions on the other side
of the bed of a little torrent, which divided the two
<a id='Page_86'></a>armies; and their force and position were not to be
despised. They were the best troops of the empire,
and commanded by a very skilful general, although
advanced in years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy's general had marched in warm pursuit
of the Republicans up to that place, and now made
every arrangement for a regular attack. Two battalions
of infantry had crossed the dry bed of the
torrent; and two pieces of artillery, placed on the
bank, thundered upon the line of Republican cavalry.
On their side, the brave men of the first brigade,
under the command of Netto, had drawn their sabres,
and waited only for the sound of the trumpet, to
launch themselves upon the two battalions which were
crossing over. Those warlike sons of the continent
felt the certainty of victory. Netto and they had
never been conquered. The infantry, échalloned by
divisions, on the highest part of the hill, and covered
by its verge, were crying out for battle. The terrible
lancers of Canabarro had already made a movement
forward, confusing the right flank of the enemy, which
was therefore obliged to change front in confusion.
The brave freedmen, proud of their force, became
more firm and resolute; and that incomparable corps
presented to view a forest of lances, being composed
entirely of slaves liberated by the Republic, and
chosen from the best horse-tamers in the province, and
all of them blacks, even the superior officers. The
enemy had never seen the backs of those true sons of
<a id='Page_87'></a>liberty. Their lances, which were longer than the
common measure, their ebony faces and robust limbs,
strengthened by perennial and laborious exercise,
and their perfect discipline, struck terror into the
enemy. The animating voice of the General-in-chief
had been heard, as he rode along the lines: "Every
one of you must fight for four men to-day!" These
were the few and only words of that distinguished
man, who possessed all the qualities of a great captain,
except good fortune. Every heart seemed to feel the
palpitation of war, and the confidence of victory. A
more beautiful day, or a more splendid scene, was
never beheld. The ground was scattered with a few
low plants, and offered no obstacle to the view, so that
everything was clearly visible, even the slightest
movement, and, as it were, all under my feet. In a
few minutes was to be decided the fate of the largest
part of the American continent, with the destinies of
a numerous people. Those bodies of men, so compact,
so orderly and steady, in a few moments will be broken
up, and some of them thrown into confusion and defeated.
Soon, the blood, the mangled limbs, and the
corpses of many of those young men will disfigure the
beautiful fields. Yes: now all are waiting and panting
for the signal of battle.—Yet in vain was all that
preparation, vain the expectation; that field was not
to be a field of slaughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy's general, intimidated at the strong
positions occupied by the Republicans, and by their
<a id='Page_88'></a>proud array, made his appearance, and had the two
battalions recalled from the opposite bank, to which
they had crossed without orders, and placed himself
on the defensive. General Calderon was killed in
making a reconnaissance. Was that the cause of the
irresolution of General Jorge? As the Republicans
were not attacked, they ought to have attacked. This
was the opinion of many; but would it have been
wise? If they had been attacked in their fine positions,
there would have been every probability of
victory; but to descend from them and meet the enemy
on equal ground, it would be necessary to cross the
bed of the torrent, which was somewhat rough and
difficult, although dry, and the superiority in numbers
of the enemy's infantry was by no means small. In fine,
there was no battle, and the enemies remained all day
in sight of each other, with only a little skirmishing.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the camp of the Republicans there was a scarcity
of meat, and the infantry especially were famishing.
But, what was still more insupportable, thirst also
prevailed, for there was no water. But that people
are hardened by a life of privations. No lamentations
were heard, except for the want of permission to
fight. Oh, Italians! oh, for the day when you shall
be united and enduring like those children of the
desert. The stranger shall not then trample upon
your soil; he shall not contaminate your air. Italy
will then take her proper place among the first nations
of the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_89'></a>That night the old general, Jorge, disappeared, and
in the morning the enemy were nowhere to be seen on
any side. The early mist remained until ten o'clock;
it then rose, and they were discovered in the strong
positions of Taguary. Soon afterwards news arrived
that their cavalry were crossing the river. The
enemy, therefore, were retreating, and it was necessary
to attack them. The Republicans made no hesitation,
and the army marched, resolved on a battle. Only
the enemy's cavalry, however, had crossed the river,
assisted in the passage by several imperial vessels, but
the infantry remained on the banks, protected by the
woods, having taken the most advantageous positions.
The second brigade of Republican infantry, composed
of the second and third battalions, was destined to
begin the attack. This was performed with all possible
bravery, but the numbers of the enemy were very
far superior, and those courageous soldiers, after performing
feats of valor, were compelled to retire, supported
by the first brigade, which consisted of the
first battalion of marines and the artillery, who had
no cannon.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was a terrible battle between the infantry in
the forest, where the reëchoing of the guns, and the
frequent flashes among the thick clouds of smoke
seemed like a raging tempest. Not less than five
hundred men were wounded and killed on both sides;
and the dead bodies of the Republicans were found on
the very bank of the river, to which they had driven
<a id='Page_90'></a>their enemies. But all this loss was of no use, for
when the second brigade retired the conflict was suspended;
then night came on, and the enemy were able
to complete their passage without interruption.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among many brilliant qualities, General Bento
Gonzales had a kind of indecision, the effect of the
disasters which had successively befallen him in his
enterprises. He would have wished that, because a
brigade of infantry, disproportionately inferior in numbers,
had thrown itself upon the enemy, the action
should be closed by making not only all the infantry
take part in it, but also the cavalry on foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a proceeding might indeed have given him a
brilliant victory, if by making the enemy lose their
footing it had thrown them into the river; and such a
result might not have been improbable. But the
general was determined to adventure everything, and
even the only infantry which the Republicans ever
possessed. The fact is, that the battle was a real
disaster to them, as they had not the ability to supply
the loss of their brave infantry, while the enemy
chiefly abounded in that kind of forces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy remained on the right bank of the
Taguary, because they were almost wholly masters of
the country. The Republicans repassed the road to
Porto Allegre, to recommence the siege of that town.
The condition of the Republic was now somewhat
worse. The army recrossed to San Leopoldo, and
then to Settembrino, and afterwards to Malacara, into
<a id='Page_91'></a>the old camp. From that place, a few days after,
they changed their encampment to Bella Vista; and at
the same time the General planned an operation, the
result of which was to restore them to excellent
positions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The enemy, for the purpose of making excursions into
the country, had partly garrisoned with infantry the
strong places. San Jose del Norte was in such a situation.
That place, which stands on the north shore
of the outlet of the Lake Dos Patos, was one of its
keys; and the possession of it would have been sufficient
to change the face of things. The town was
taken, and the Republican troops gave themselves up
to pillage and riot.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime the Imperialists, having recovered
from their surprise, assembled in a strong quarter, and
made head. The Republicans assaulted them and
were repulsed. The combatants endeavored to renew
the attack, but did not meet, or, if they met, they
were unfit for fighting. Some had damaged their
muskets by breaking doors, and others had lost their
flints. The enemy lost no time. A few vessels of war
lay in the harbor. They took positions and raked the
<a id='Page_93'></a>streets occupied by the Republicans, sent to Southern
Rio Grande for aid, and occupied the only fort which
they had not taken. The largest fort, called the Emperor's
Fort, situated in the centre of the line of fortifications,
and which had cost them a great assault,
was rendered useless by a tremendous explosion, which
killed and wounded a great number. In short, the
greatest triumph was changed, towards noon, to a
shameful retreat, almost to a flight. Good men wept
with anger and disappointment. The loss of the Republicans
was comparatively immense. From that
time their infantry was a mere skeleton. A few cavalry
belonged to the expedition, and they served as a
protection on the retreat. The division marched to
their barracks of Buena Vista, and I remained at San
Simon with the marine, which was reduced to about
fifty individuals, including officers and soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>My object in staying at that place was to prepare
some canoes, (boats made of single trees,) and to open
communications with the other parts of the lake; but,
in the months which I spent there, the canoes did not
make their appearance; and for the reason that they
had existed only in idea. Instead of boats, I therefore
occupied myself with procuring horses, there being an
abundance of wild ones, which furnished much occupation
to the sailors, who became so many knights,
though all of them did not manage their steeds with
superior dexterity. And San Simon is a very beautiful
and spacious place, although at that time
<a id='Page_94'></a>destroyed and abandoned. It was said to belong to an
exiled Count San Simon, or his exiled heirs, who had
left home because of opinions different from those of
the Republicans. There being no masters there, we
strangers fed on the cattle and rode the horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that place our first child was born, on the 10th of
September, 1840. The young mother, although so short
a time before united to her martial husband, had already
passed through many trials and dangers. After the
terrible affair with the Brazilian men of war, she had
accompanied me on the marches, and even in the battles
described in the preceding pages, and had endured great
fatigue and hunger, and had several falls from her
horse. During her stay at the house of an inhabitant
of the place, she received the greatest kindness from
the family and their neighbors; and I shall ever entertain
to those who have shown kindness to me, and especially
to my wife, "Sarò reconoscientissimo, a
quella buona gente, tutta la mia vita" (I shall be most
thankful to those good people all my life.) It was of
the highest importance that she had the comforts of
that house and those friends at that time, for the miseries
suffered by the army then rose to their height,
and I was absolutely destitute of everything necessary
for my wife and little son; and in order to procure
some clothes, I determined to make a journey to Settembrina,
where I had several friends, particularly the
kind-hearted Blingini, who would cheerfully supply me
with some things I wished to procure for them. I
<a id='Page_95'></a>accordingly set out to cross the inundated fields of that
part of the province, then all drenched by the rains.
I travelled day after day in water up to my horse's
belly, and crossed the Rossa Velha, (an old cultivated
field,) where I met Captain Massimo, of the Free Lancers,
who treated me like a true and good friend, as he
was. He was posted for the guard of the Cavalladas.
I arrived at that place at evening, in a heavy rain,
and spent the night; and the next day the storm having
increased, the good Captain determined to detain
me at all hazards,—but I was too much in haste to accomplish
my object, to be willing to defer my journey,
and I set off again, in spite of every remonstrance, to
brave the flood. After going a few miles, I heard several
musket-shots in the direction of the place I had
left, which raised some suspicion in my mind, but I
could only go on. Having reached Settembrina, I
bought some little articles of clothing, and set out on
my return towards San Simon. When I had recrossed
the Rossa Velha, I learned the cause of the firing I
had heard, and the most melancholy accident which
happened on the day of my departure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moringue, the man who surprised me at Camacua,
had now surprised Captain Massimo, and notwithstanding
a very brave resistance, left him dead, with almost
all his thirty lancers of the garrison. Most of the
horses, including the best of them, had been embarked,
the remaining ones were almost all killed. Moringue
executed the operation with vessels of war and infantry,
<a id='Page_96'></a>and then reëmbarked the infantry, going himself by
land towards Rio Grande del Norte, alarming all the
little forces, which, thinking themselves safe, were scattered
about that territory. Among these was my band
of sailors, who were obliged to take their clubs and
go into the woods, taking my wife with them, who
mounted the saddle, to avoid the enemy, with her infant,
then only twelve days old, although it was in the
midst of the storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>On my return I could not find any of my men, or any
of the friends with whom I had left my family; but I
discovered them at length in the edge of a wood, where
they remained without any certain news of the enemy.
We went back to San Simon, where I remained some
time, and then removed my camp to the left bank of
the Capivari.</p>

<p class='c006'>The river Capivari is formed by the confluence of the
different outlets of numerous lakes which garnish the
northern border of the Province of Rio Grande,
between the sea-coast and the eastern side of the
chain of Espinasso. It received its name from the
Capivari, a species of amphibious animal, very
common in the rivers of South America. We made
two canoes, and in them made several voyages to the
western shore of Lake Patos, transporting both men
and provisions. These voyages we performed from
the Capivari and the Sangrador de Abreu, one of the
streams in that vicinity, which is an outlet of a pond,
connecting it with a lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime the situation of the Republican
army grew worse and worse. Every day their necessities
became more pressing, while, at the same time,
the difficulty of satisfying them became greater. The
two battles of Taguare and Norte had destroyed the
<a id='Page_98'></a>infantry, so that the battalions had become mere skeletons.
Prevailing wants produced discontent, and that
led to desertions. The inhabitants, as usually happens
in long wars, were wearied, and looked with indifference
upon the forces of the two parties. In such a
state of things the Imperialists made proposals for an
arrangement which, although advantageous, considering
the circumstances of the Republicans, were not
acceptable and not accepted by the most generous
portion of the enemy. Their rejection much increased
the discontent of the extreme and disgusted party,
and finally the abandonment of the siege, and the
retreat were decisive. The Canabarro division, of
which the marine formed a part, was to begin the
movement, and climb the passes of the Serra, occupied
by General Labattue. Bento Gonzales, with the rest
of the army, was to march behind, covering the movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that time died Rosetti, an irreparable loss to the
army, and especially to myself. Having been left
with the Republican garrison of Settembrina, which
was to march last, he was surprised by the famous
Maringue; and that incomparable Italian perished
fighting bravely. Having fallen from his horse
wounded, he was called on to surrender,—but he sold
his life dearly. There is not a spot of ground on
earth in which do not lie the bones of some generous
Italian, for whose sake Italy ought never to cease from
the struggle until free herself. She will feel the want
<a id='Page_99'></a>of them in the day when she shall rise to drive the
ravens from the corpses which they devour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The retreat was commenced in the worst season,
among the broken ridges of the mountain, in an almost
unintermitted rain, and was the most disagreeable
and terrible which I had ever seen. We had supplied
ourselves with a few cows, which we brought with
us, there being no animals among the toilsome paths
which we were to travel, made impracticable by the
rains. The numerous rivers were extremely swollen,
and much of the baggage was carried away by the
torrents. The troops marched in the rain, and without
food; encamped without food in the rain. Between
one river and another, those who were appointed to
keep near the cows, had meat, but the others were in
a terrible condition, especially the poor infantry, for
everything failed them except horse-flesh. There
were some dreadful scenes. Many women followed
the army, according to the custom of the country, and
many children. But few of the latter came out of the
forest, and some were picked up by the horsemen, one
of whom, here and there, was fortunate enough to save
his horse, and with him a poor little creature, left by
its dead or dying mother, who had fallen a victim to
hunger, fatigue, and cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anna was much distressed by the apprehension of
losing her little son, Menotti, who was saved with
difficulty, and as if by a miracle. In the most difficult
parts of the road, and in crossing rivers, I carried
<a id='Page_100'></a>my poor little child, then three months old, in a handkerchief
tied round my neck, contriving to keep him
warm with my breath. Of about a dozen animals—horses
and mules—with which we entered the woods,
some of them used for the saddle and some for baggage,
there remained only two horses and two mules.
The others had tired, and were abandoned. To crown
our misfortunes, the guides had mistaken the road;
and that was one of the reasons which induced us to
cross the terrible woods of Las Antas. The word
"Anta" signifies a harmless animal, of the size of an
ass, whose flesh is exquisite, and whose hide serves for
making many strong and many ornamental articles.
This animal, however, I never had the fortune to see.
Although the troops continued to proceed, they could
not find the end of the piccada; and I remained in
the woods, with two tired mules, and sent Anna,
with her servant and the child, to endeavor to find a
clear place where they might obtain some food for
themselves and the animals. The two remaining
horses, which were used alternately, with the surprising
courage of the mother, overcame every difficulty.
She succeeded in getting beyond the piccada, and
fortunately found some of the soldiers with a fire, a
very rare thing, and then not always to be obtained, on
account of the continued rain, and the miserable condition
to which we were all reduced. The men
warmed some cloths, took the infant and wrapped him
in them, and thus resuscitated him. The poor mother
<a id='Page_101'></a>who had given up almost every hope of his life,
took him again and cherished him with the tenderest
care, while the good-hearted soldiers went to seek for
some kind of food to restore the exhausted strength
of the mother. I labored in vain to save the mules.
Being left alone with them, I cut as many as I could
of the leaves of the baguara, a species of cane, and
gave them to eat; but it was of no use. I was obliged
to abandon them, and seek to get out of the forest on
foot, and exceedingly fatigued.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nine days after entering it, the last of the division
barely got through the piccada, and only a very few of
the horses of the officers were saved. The enemy,
who had preceded us in their flight, had left some
artillery in the forest of the Antas, which the pursuers
were unable to transport, for the want of means, and
they were left buried in certain caverns—who knows
for how long? In that woody region the storms
seemed as if tired out; for, on getting into the open
fields of the elevated plain, called the Cima da Serra
(or top of the ridge), the troops found good weather.
Some oxen, which were discovered there, afforded
them a welcome supply of food, and made some
amends for the sufferings they had passed through.
They then entered the department of Vaccaria, in
which they remained several days, waiting for the
division of Bento Gonzales, which joined them much
broken, and in a miserable state. The indefatigable
Maringue, informed of their retreat, had pursued that
<a id='Page_102'></a>division and harassed it in every way, aided by the
mountaineers, who were always decidedly hostile to
the Republicans.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these things gave Labattue as much time as was
required for his retreat and junction with the Imperial
army. They arrived, however, almost without men, in
consequence of desertions occasioned by the severe
and forced march, and privations, and sufferings
endured by the other troops. Beside all these, he had
an adventure, which deserves to be mentioned here on
account of its remarkable nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Labattue being obliged to pass in his march through
the two forests known by the names of the Mattos or
woods of Portugues and Castellano, met in them
several tribes of the Bugre Indians, the most savage
in Brazil. These, knowing of the passage of
the Imperialists, assailed them, laying ambushes in
different places in the bushes, and did them much
injury, letting us know, at the same time, that they
were friends of the Republicans. In accordance
with this profession, my comrades and I myself experienced
no inconvenience from them on our march;
but we saw the <i>poge</i>, or holes, carefully covered with
grass, into which the incautious enemy might fall,
when the savages would take advantage of his misfortune
and assault him. But all these were left open
where the Republicans were to pass, that we might
not be exposed to the danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>On one of those days I met a woman, who had been
<a id='Page_103'></a>stolen by the savages in her youth, and profited by the
opportunity offered by the neighborhood of the troops.
The poor creature was in a most pitiable state.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we had no enemies to fly from or to pursue in those
lofty regions, we proceeded slowly on our march,
almost entirely destitute of horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The corps of Free Lancers, being entirely dismounted,
were obliged to supply themselves with wild colts; and
it was a fine sight which was presented almost every
day, to see a multitude of those robust young black
men, leaping upon the backs of their wild coursers,
and rushing across the fields like a thunderstorm.
The animal used every exertion to gain his freedom
and to throw off his hated rider; while the man, with
admirable dexterity, strength and courage, continued
to press him with his legs, drawing in his feet against
his sides like pincers, whip and drive him, until he at
length tired out the superb son of the desert.</p>

<p class='c007'>In that part of America the colt comes from the field
lassoed, and is saddled, bridled, and rode by the
domator, or horse-breaker, and in a few days obeys
the bit. Experienced men obtain many excellent
horses in a short time; but few come out well broken
from the hands of soldiers, especially when they are
<a id='Page_105'></a>on a march, where neither the necessary conveniences
can be obtained, nor the necessary care taken to break
them well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having passed the Mattos Portuguez and Castellano,
we descended into the province of "Missiones,"
proceeding towards Cruz Alta, its chief town. It is
a very small place, but well built, situated on a high
plain and in a beautiful position; as fine, indeed, as all
that part of the State of Rio Grande. The troops
marched from Cruz Alta to San Gabriel, where the
head-quarters were established and barracks were constructed
for the encampment of the army. I built a
cottage, and spent some time in it with my little
family; but six years of a life of dangers and sufferings,
far from the company of old friends, my father
and mother, from whom I had no news, among that
people, isolated by the war with the empire, made me
wish to return to some place where I might obtain
information concerning my parents. I now found
that although, amidst the scenes of bustle and trial
through which I had passed, I had been able to
banish the recollection of their affection for a time,
my love for them remained lively and warm in my
heart. It was necessary to improve my circumstances,
for the benefit of my wife and child, and I determined
to make a journey to Montevideo, even if but for a
short time. I asked and obtained permission from the
President, who also allowed me to take a small herd
of young cattle, to pay the expenses of travelling.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_106'></a>And here I took up the business of a cattle-drover,
or <i>trappiere</i>. In an Estancia, called the Corral del
Piedras, under the authority of the Minister of Finance,
I succeeded in collecting, in about twenty days,
about nine hundred cattle, after indescribable fatigue.
With a still greater degree of labor and weariness they
were driven towards Montevideo. Thither, however, I
did not succeed in driving them. Insuperable obstacles
presented themselves on the way, and, more than
all, the Rio Negro, which crossed it, and in which I
nearly lost all this capital. From that river, from the
effects of my inexperience and from the tricks of some
of my hired assistants for managing the drove of
animals, I saved about five hundred of the cattle,
which, by the long journey, scarcity of food and accidents
in crossing streams, were thought unfit to go to
Montevideo.</p>

<p class='c007'>I therefore decided to "<i>cuercer</i>" or "<i>leather</i>" them,—that
is, to kill them for their hides; and this was done.
In fact, after having passed through indescribable
fatigue and troubles, for about fifty days, I arrived at
Montevideo with a few hides, the only remains of my
nine hundred oxen. These I sold for only a few hundred
dollars, which served but scantily to clothe my
little family.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Montevideo I spent some of my time in the house
of my friend Napoleon Castellani, to whose kindness,
and the courtesy of his wife, I felt much indebted.
I acknowledge my obligations also to my dear
<a id='Page_107'></a>friends, Giovanni Battista Cuneo and Giovanni Risso.
Having a family, but my means being exhausted, I felt
it necessary to provide for the subsistence of the three
individuals of whom it consisted. Other people's
bread always seemed to me bitter, whenever in my
diversified life I have found it necessary to partake of
it; and I have been so happy as never to be dependant
on any friend. Two occupations, of small profit, it
is true, but which would afford me a subsistence, I
assumed for a time. They were those of a broker and
a teacher of mathematics, given in the house and to
the pupils of the estimable instructor, Signor Paolo
Semidei. This manner of life I pursued until I entered
the Oriental squadron.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rio Grande question was approaching a settlement,
and there was nothing more to be thought on
that subject. The Oriental Republic soon offered me
employment, and I accepted it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was appointed to proceed on an expedition, the
results of which, through either ignorance or malignity,
proved ruinous.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the sloop Constitucion, of eighteen guns, the
brig Terceira, of two eighteen pounders, and a transport,
the schooner Procida, I was ordered to proceed to Corrientes,
an allied province, to assist in their military
operations against the forces of Rosas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Oriental Republic of the Uruguay, like the
greater part of the Republics of South America, was a
prey to intestine disputes; and the occasion then was
<a id='Page_108'></a>the pretension of two Generals to the Presidency, viz:
Rivera and Ouribes. Rivera, being more successful,
succeeded after several victories, in driving away Ouribes,
and gained possession of the power which he had
held. The latter, being expelled, took refuge in
Buenos Ayres, where the Dictator, Rosas, received
him, together with many Oriental emigrants, and employed
them against his enemy, who were then under
the command of General Lavalle. Lavalle being conquered,
the ferocious Ex-president of Montevideo undertook
to regain his lost power in his own country.
In that Rosas found the object most agreeable to his
wishes; that is, the destruction of the Unitarians, or
Centralists, his mortal enemies, who were supported by
the Oriental State; and the ruin of a neighboring Republic,
his rival, which disputed with him the supremacy
of the immense river, by throwing into her bosom
the most terrible elements of civil war.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time when I embarked on the river, the Oriental
army was at San Jose de Uruguay, and that of
Ouribes at La Bajada, the capital of the province
of Entre Rios, both making preparations for a great
conflict. The army of Corrientes then made arrangements
for uniting with the Oriental. I was to go up
the Parana to Corrientes, pass over a distance of more
than six hundred miles, between two banks occupied by
the enemy, where I would be unable to anchor, unless
at islands and desert places.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>ORIGIN OF THE WAR BETWEEN MONTEVIDEO AND BUENOS
AYRES.—CHARACTER AND CONDUCT OF ROSAS, OURIBES—THE
CENTRALISTS, CALLED UNITARIANS, OPPOSED TO THE
REPUBLICANS.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>As has been said, the war in Montevideo was caused
by the personal ambition of the two generals, Ouribes
and Rivera, who were aspirants for the Presidency of
the republic. The former was defeated by the latter,
about the year 1840, and obliged to emigrate to Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that time Rosas, the tyrant of Buenos Ayres, was
engaged in war with the Centralists, or Unitarians, who
were the national and liberal party, and were led by Generals
Lavalle and Paz. Rosas received Ouribes and many
of his partizans, and gave them immediate employment
in his own army, while he conferred the supreme
command of it upon the emigrant General. Ouribes,
being able to bring many reinforcements to the tyrant's
army, which was already strong, defeated Lavalle, who
died in the upper provinces of the Argentine Republic
(I think Mendoza,) in a surprise. General Paz, by intrigues
and dissensions, was obliged to abandon the
struggle, after the brilliant victory of Caguazú, and
<a id='Page_110'></a>to return to Montevideo, where the greater part of
the Centralists who had fought against Rosas had retreated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Argentine Republic being pressed by enemies,
Ouribes descended towards Montevideo, and established
his camp at Bajada, the capital of the province of
Entre-Rios, having under his command an imposing
army, and meditating with Rosas, the invasion of the
State of Montevideo. Rivera was then on the left
bank of the Uruguay, preparing and receiving all the
forces which he could dispose of, and doubtless expecting
to be attacked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wise would have been the resolution to await the
enemy in his own positions; but, having much confidence
in himself, and strengthened by the junction
with the army of Corrientes, he made arrangements to
cross the river, and seek the enemy. The Oriental
and Corrientes armies amounted to ten thousand men.
Ouribes had fourteen thousand, and was much superior
in infantry and artillery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle was short; and the combined armies were
entirely defeated on the Arroyo Grande. Ouribes
passed the Uruguay, invaded the territory of Montevideo,
and then laid siege to the capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>The catastrophe of Arroyo Grande, and the certainty
that the implacable ex-president would come,
meditating terrible revenge, stimulated the population
of the State of Montevideo to take up arms <i>en masse</i>
and repel the invasion by force. It should here be
<a id='Page_111'></a>observed, that the war had changed its character, and
it was no longer a personal consideration in favor of
Rivera which induced the people to take up arms; but
the fear of becoming subject to the depredations and
excesses of a foreign and barbarous enemy, led them
to fight for the independence of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beginning of patriotism, which then animated
the people, was the same which led them to so many
heroic deeds, and to sustain the most desperate of
struggles, at the cost of unheard of sacrifices. Then
began the glorious contest carried on by the Montevideans,
which still continues, and which will astonish
the world, when its events are exactly known.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Paz, reduced to Montevideo, after the
unfortunate occurrences in the Argentine State, was
received with acclamation by the government and
people, as general of the nascent army; and to him
are certainly due the beginnings of bravery and discipline
by which it was distinguished, as well as the
system of defence which was adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rivera kept the field, made skilful movements, and
was defeated by Ouribes at India Muerta. The errors
of Rivera and his conflicts completed his discredit, and
entirely removed him from the scene of events. He is
now an emigrant in Rio Janeiro, and I do not think
his influence can produce any disturbance on the Rio
de la Plata.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of Montevideo, therefore, reduces itself
to the following, at the present epoch (1850):</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_112'></a>Rosas, the tyrant of Buenos Ayres, and chiefly interested
in the humiliation of Montevideo, maintains
an army in besieging that city, in order to destroy it.
That army is commanded by a Montevidean, who
wishes, at any cost, to command in his country; and
the people of Montevideo are fighting against that
army, because they are not willing to submit to the
hated and abominated domination of Rosas and Ouribes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Indignant at the sight of such a scene of arrogant
and inhuman oppression as that presented in Buenos
Ayres and the Argentine Republic, I was impelled to
present myself in opposition to the Dictator, and to
adopt the cause of the injured as my own. Having
mingled with the people in my own country, and all
my experience, short as it was, having taught me to
sympathize with them, against the old and hereditary
aristocracy of Europe, I could not regard with indifference
the upstart oppressor, Rosas, so treacherous to
the principles of equality and republicanism, which he
pretended to love, while violating them, in the grossest
manner, for his own insatiable ambition. Notwithstanding
the depressed condition of the true patriot
party in Montevideo, on my arrival in that city, circumstances
ere long proved favorable; and on their
beginning to renew their movements, I appeared
among them with my native activity and zeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>I conceived the idea of performing an important
service for my own country, while devoting myself to
<a id='Page_113'></a>that in which I was residing. I soon perceived that
the spirit and character of the Italians needed great
efforts, to raise them from the depressed state in which
they existed in fact, as well as in the opinion of the
world; and I was determined to elevate them, by such
a practical training as alone could secure the end.</p>

<p class='c007'>By means of Napoleon's treachery to the cause of
liberty, which he had pretended to espouse on entering
Italy, that unhappy country had been led to a ruin
more deep and complete than any of the other of his
victims; for she had been, more than any other, reduced
to spiritual slavery, as well as temporal. The
allies (with Protestant Prussia and England among
them,) had restored the papacy along with monarchy
and aristocracy; and yet the Italians were vilified as a
degenerate race, and falsely accused of having brought
their misfortunes upon themselves, by their ignorance,
fanaticism and pusillanimity.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were many Italians in Montevideo, whose condition
and feelings I soon learned to appreciate. They
were regarded with scorn by many of the other foreign
residents, especially the French, who were in
much greater numbers, and seemed to take pleasure in
humiliating my poor and injured countrymen.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was not the first case, though one of the most
marked and unrighteous, in which the wronged and
suffering party were made to bear the reproach of
those very traits of character displayed by their strong
and false-hearted conquerors. In exile and poverty,
under the bitter and hourly personal experience of their
national misfortunes, and reproached by the world
with having brought them upon themselves, the Italians
in South America were depressed and disheartened
by their gloomy recollections, their present sorrows
and their cloudy future. Many of them were occupying
themselves with such labors and business as they could
<a id='Page_115'></a>find or invent, to obtain the means of subsistence, and
laying the foundations of the fortunes which they have
since accumulated by industry and economy; but few
formed any sanguine expectations of gaining that distinction
for military prowess, which the more numerous
and vaunting Frenchmen around them then arrogated
to themselves. I, however, ere long, began to
indulge in more daring anticipations; and the sequel
will show the results.</p>

<p class='c007'>I resolved to find employment for some of them, and
to raise the courage and hopes of all, and at the same
time to prepare them for future service as soldiers in
Italy, by bringing them into the service which was
offered to myself. My progress and success will be seen
in the following chapters.</p>

<p class='c007'>On my entering the service of the Oriental Republic,
I received the command of the sloop of war "Constitucion."
The Oriental squadron was under the command
of Colonel Cahe; the enemy under the orders
of General Brown. Several battles had taken place,
but with results of but little consequence. At the
same time a man named Vidal was appointed Minister
General of the Republic,—a person of unfortunate and
despicable memory. One of his first and most fatal
steps was, to gain the dislike of the squadron, which
proved highly injurious to its condition, which had
cost the Republic immense sums, and which, if it had
been cherished as it might then have been, would have
established a marked preëminence in the Rio de la
<a id='Page_116'></a>Plata, but which was completely ruined, by selling the
vessels at shamefully low prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>I proceeded up the river with the vessels. We had
an engagement with the batteries of Martin Garcia,
which are situated near the confluence of the two
great rivers Paraná and Uruguay, near which I had
to pass, as there was no other channel for large vessels.
I had several killed and wounded, and passed on.
Among the dead was the brave Italian officer, Pocaroba,
whose head was taken off by a cannon shot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three miles beyond Martin Garcia, the Constitucion
was careened, but unfortunately at a time when the
tide was falling; and it cost an immense amount of
labor to get her afloat again. It was only due to the
most persevering labor, that the flotilla was saved from
being lost in those dangerous circumstances. While
employed in removing heavy articles on board the
Procida, the enemy's squadron appeared on the other
side of the island, approaching under full sail. I was
thus placed in a terrible condition,—the larger of my
vessels lying on the sand, and deprived of her heaviest
guns, which were placed in the Procida; the Procida
being in consequence useless; and no vessel remaining
except the Terceira, whose brave commander was near
me with the greater part of his crew, assisting in his
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime the enemy moved on proudly, presenting
a superb sight, and hailed by the acclamations
of the troops on the island, assured of victory, with
<a id='Page_117'></a>seven strong ships of war. But I felt no despair—a
feeling which I have never known. The cause I have
never pretended to give. I did not think of my life at
that moment; that appeared to me of little value: but
it seemed that dying would not save honor, and it was
impossible to fight in my position. Providence extended
his hand over my destiny, and I desired no
other. The ship of the Admiral grounded near the
island; his pride was humbled, and the Republicans
were safe. The enemy's misfortune redoubled their
alacrity; in a few hours the Constitucion was afloat,
and received her guns and loading. "Misfortunes
never come single," says the proverb. A very thick
fog concealed us, and everything we did, from the eyes
of the enemy; and favored us greatly, by preventing
them from knowing which way we went. This was of
the greatest advantage: for, when the Imperialists got
their ships under way, being ignorant of the direction
we had taken, they sailed to pursue us, and went up
the Uruguay, which we had not entered, and they
consequently lost many days before they learned our
course.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime I had entered the Paraná, under
cover of the fog and with the favor of the wind. I
had the direction of the whole operation, and must
pronounce it one of the most arduous of my life.
But certainly, in that day, the pleasure afforded by the
escape from that imminent danger, and the solicitude
caused by reflecting on the greatness of the enterprise
<a id='Page_118'></a>were embittered by the stupor and disaffection of my
companions, who until that moment had believed they
were going to the Uruguay. All declared that they
were unacquainted with the Paraná, and that they refused
all responsibility from that moment. Responsibility
was of little importance to me; but something
was to be done in some way or other. After a few
inquiries, one man confessed that he knew a little of
the river, but that he was confused by his fears; however,
he was soon able to collect himself, and proved
useful. The wind favoring, we soon arrived near San
Nicolas, the first town in the Argentine territory,
which is situated on the right shore of the river.
There we found a few merchant vessels, which were
wanted for transports and other service, and, in a
night expedition with launches, both were obtained.
An Austrian, named Antonio, who had been trading
for a long time in the Paraná, was among the prisoners,
and he rendered important services in the voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Proceeding up the river, we met with no obstacle
until we reached Bajada, where was the army of
Ouribes. I operated in the transit. Some landed to
find fresh provisions, which consisted chiefly of oxen,
in which they were opposed by the inhabitants, and
some troops of cavalry stationed there to guard the
shore. Several partial engagements took place on
that account—with some advantages and losses, sometimes
on one side and sometimes on the other—in one
of which I had the great affliction of losing the brave
<a id='Page_119'></a>Italian officer, Lalberga di Leone, a youth of surprising
valor and of most promising genius. Another
monument, therefore, was demanded for another son
of the land of misfortune, who, like so many more, had
hoped to shed his blood for the redemption of his
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Bajada, the capital of Entre Rios, where the army
of Ouribes was stationed, I found the most formidable
preparations on my arrival; and a battle seemed at
first inevitable: but the wind being favorable, and we
being able to pass at a considerable distance from the
enemy's batteries, but little effect was produced by the
heavy cannonade which was made by them. At Las
Conchas, a few miles above La Bajada, I effected a
landing by night, which procured me fourteen oxen, in
spite of strong opposition made by the enemy. My
men fought with great bravery. The enemy's artillery
followed the coast, and profiting by the contrary wind
and the narrowness of the river, cannonaded us whenever
they could. At Cerito, a position on the left bank
of the stream, they established a battery of six guns.
The wind was favorable, but light; and at that point,
on account of the crookedness of the river, our vessels
had to sail in face of them, so that it was necessary to
go about two miles under a battery, which was as if
suspended over our heads. A resolute battle was
fought at that place. The greater part of my men
seemed unable to rise, and did not show themselves.
The others, at their guns, fought and labored with
<a id='Page_120'></a>great alacrity. It should be remembered that the enemy
belonged to a party rendered proud by their
victory, who soon after conquered, at Arroyo Grande,
the two combined armies of Montevideo and Corrientes.
Every obstacle was overcome with very little
loss; and after having stopped all the enemy's fire, and
dismounted several pieces of artillery, a number of
merchant vessels, coming from Corrientes and Paraguay,
which had been placed under the protection of
the enemy's battery, fell into the power of the Republicans
with very little trouble. Those prizes supplied
us with provisions and means of all kinds.</p>

<p class='c007'>We then proceeded on our arduous voyage up the
river. The enemy watched us in order to throw obstacles
in our way; but we arrived at Cavallo-quattia,
(or the White Horse,) where we joined the Argentine
flotilla, composed of two large launches and a balandra
armed as a war-vessel. We were thus supplied
with some fresh provisions, so that our condition was
much improved. We had good and experienced men,
but a reinforcement was agreeable enough, especially
in its effects on the habits of our men. Having thus
proceeded as far as the Brava coast, we were obliged
to stop on account of the shallow water, the difference
of which, with the draft of the Constitucion, was four
palms. These difficulties began to excite some suspicions
in my mind, concerning the final result of the expedition.
I had no doubt that the enemy would do
their utmost to defeat it; for if it should arrive at
<a id='Page_121'></a>Corrientes the injury would have been very great to
the enemy, by the Republicans having command of an
intermediate part of the river, by holding an intermediate
position between the interior provinces, the Paraguay
and the capital of the Argentine confederation.
It would have been a kind of nest of corsairs, to
infest and destroy the enemy's commerce.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy accordingly resorted to every measure for
our ruin; and they were greatly favored by the want
of water in the river, which was altogether unexampled
for half a century, according to the declaration
of Governor Ferri, of Corrientes. It being impossible
to proceed further, I determined to put the flotilla
in the best possible state for resistance. From the
left bank of the Paraná, where the depth of water was
greatest, I drew a line of vessels, beginning with a
merchant <i>yate</i>, in which were placed four guns; the
Terceira in the middle, and the Constitucion on the
right wing, thus forming a row, at right angles to the
shore, and presenting to the enemy all the force possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>This arrangement cost much labor, in consequence
of the current, which, although small, in that open
place, required the use of all the chains and cables to
anchor the vessels, especially the Constitucion, the heaviest
of all. These labors were not terminated when the
enemy made their appearance with seven vessels, a
superior force, and in a situation where they could receive
reinforcements and supplies of every kind. The
Republican flotilla, on the contrary, was far from Corrientes,
the only part of the country from which they
could obtain assistance, and where it was almost certain
no aid would be received, as the result proved to
be too true. It was thought necessary, however, to
fight, at least for the honor of arms; and an engagement
ensued.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy, under the command of General Brown,
<a id='Page_123'></a>who enjoyed the highest reputation as a maritime officer
in South America, and justly, too, proceeded in all
the confidence of their power. They had a favorable
wind though a light one, keeping along the left
bank, the right being impracticable. As I had command
of the left bank, on which rested the left flank
of his line, I landed part of my soldiers and sailors, to
dispute the enemy's advance, inch by inch. The Republicans
fought bravely, and greatly retarded the enemy's
advance; but the superior force of the latter
prevailed, and the former were driven under the protection
of their vessels. Major Pedro Rodriguez, who
commanded our force on land, fought that day with all
imaginable skill and valor. He placed the outposts
towards evening; and thus they remained through the
whole night, both parties preparing for battle on the
following day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun had not risen on the 16th of June, when the
enemy began a cannonade, with all the force which they
had been laboring to bring to the front in the night.
The battle was then commenced; and it continued
without interruption till nightfall, being sustained on
both sides with great resolution. The first victim
on board the Constitucion was again an Italian officer,
of great bravery and of the highest promise, Guiseppe
Barzone; and I regretted that I could not take charge
of his remains, in consequence of the fury of the contest.
Much damage was done on both sides. The
Republican vessels were riddled and shattered. The
<a id='Page_124'></a>corvette, in consequence of not having her shot-holes
accurately stopped, leaked so much that she could not
be kept afloat without great difficulty, the pumps being
at work without cessation. The commandant of the
Terceira had been killed in a most daring enterprise
by land against the enemy's vessels. In him I lost my
best and bravest companion. The killed were numerous,
and still more the wounded. The remaining time
I was constantly occupied on account of the sinking
condition of the vessels. However, there were still
powder and shot on board, and we must fight—not
for victory, not to save ourselves, but for honor.
Some men laugh at the honors of a soldier; but Italians
have given strong proof of the existence and
power of such a principle in their breasts, particularly
in other places and at a later period than that to
which we are now attending, especially when Rome
was surrounded by the armies of four nations, in 1849,
and long defended herself. Those who scoff at the
idea of honor in an honest soldier who fights for his
friends and country, can too often show base respect
for men who abuse and assassinate their fellow-beings,
or who claim to be the supporters of their political or
religious opinions, though they may be monsters in
cruelty or infamous in vice, especially if surrounded
with the power of the great or the splendor of
courts.</p>

<p class='c007'>We fought for honor, although six hundred miles distant
from Montevideo, with enemies from all quarters,
<a id='Page_125'></a>after a series of battles, privations and misfortunes,
and almost sure of losing everything. In the meantime
Vidal, the minister of war of the Republic,
squandered doubloons to support his splendid banquets,
in the first capitals of Europe. Such is the honor of
the world! It is thus that the lives of generous Italians
are despised and sacrificed, and they are buried in
a land of exile, in the continent of their countryman,
Columbus, or in other regions of the earth. Such was
Castelli, who was beheaded at Buenos Ayres; Borso
di Carminati, shot in Spain;—and this, although they
were superior men, and had rendered great services to
ungrateful foreigners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their sympathy those foreigners have shown for thee,
O Italy! when thy aged and venerable head was raised
for a moment in Rome, from the lethargy of opprobrium
in which thy oppressors had conspired to hold
thee, thou Mother, Instructress and Mistress of Nations!
When thou once more shalt rouse thyself, they will
tremble at the defeat of their united powers, combined
in the league of Hell, to oppress and degrade thee.
Be great, then, once more, O Italy! and then the
powerful voice of the Almighty will be heard by
all thy sons; and the hungry and cowardly vultures
which destroy thee, will be stunned by its thundering
sound.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the night of the 16th all my men were occupied
in preparing cartridges, which were almost entirely
exhausted, and in cutting up chains to supply the
<a id='Page_126'></a>want of balls, and in the incessant pumping of the
leaky vessels. Manuel Rodriguez, the same Catalonian
officer who had been saved with me from shipwreck
on the coast of Santa Caterina, was occupied,
with a few of the best, in fitting up several merchant
vessels as fireships, with the greatest possible quantity
of combustibles, and directing them towards the
enemy. That expedient incommoded them during the
night, but did not produce the effect desired; the
chief defect of the Republicans being the extreme
scarcity of men. Between the various mishaps of that
dreadful night, that which most afflicted me was the
defection of the little squadron of Corrientes. Villegas,
the commandant, like many others whom I have seen
bold in a calm, became so much terrified by approaching
danger, that it was impossible to make him useful
in any way to the allied vessels, although they were
manned with good sailors, and fitted for any kind of
service on the river, by their swiftness. Seeing Villegas
not quite self-possessed, I ordered him to take
his place behind the line of battle, where I had placed
the hospital—a small vessel destined to that use.
Towards evening he sent me word that he had changed
his position to a short distance, for what motive I
could not imagine. Needing his coöperation in the
work of the fireships, I sent for Villegas in the night,
and received the alarming news that he was nowhere
to be found. Not being willing to think him capable
of so much treachery, I went myself in a light palischermo,
<a id='Page_127'></a>to satisfy myself of the truth. Not finding
him, I proceeded several miles towards Corrientes, but
in vain; and I returned, in bitterness of soul. My
fears were unhappily too well founded, for most of
the little vessels were destroyed in the service before
the engagement began. I had counted on the Correntine
vessels to receive the wounded and to contain
the provisions necessary for all, as we were still far
distant from the inhabited frontier of Corrientes.
My last hope was now lost, by a cowardly retreat,
which is the greatest of crimes when committed in the
moment of danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>I returned on board my vessel a short time before daybreak.
A fight was inevitable, but I saw nothing around
me but men lying down overcome with fatigue, and
heard no sound except the lamentations of the unfortunate
wounded, who had not yet been transported to the
hospital. Being now unable to wait any longer, I
gave the signal and ordered the men to their stations.
I gave the orders and spoke a few words of comfort
and encouragement, which were not in vain, as I
found my companions, although spent with fatigue,
with spirit remaining which could yet be excited. They
replied with a general cry for battle, and every man
was immediately at his post. The engagement was
recommenced when it was hardly light; but, if the
advantage appeared to be on our side in the previous
affair, we now decidedly had the worst. The new
cartridges had been made of bad powder; we had
<a id='Page_128'></a>used all the balls of proper size for the calibre of the
guns, and those we now had were smaller, and, therefore,
in going out, did much injury to the pieces, which
had before done such service against the enemy. The
latter observed the weakness of our fire, and being
then informed of our condition by some deserters,
showed great joy, while their vessels, which were
unable the day preceding to form a line, now effected
it in security. Thus the condition and prospects of
the Republicans were growing worse and worse, while
those of their enemies every moment improved. At
length a retreat became necessary, not with the
vessels, for it was impossible to move them from their
positions, in consequence of their broken condition,
the want of water, and the miserable state of the
crews. Nothing could be hoped for but the saving of
their lives. I therefore gave orders for landing, in a
few small boats which remained, the wounded, the
arms, the little ammunition left, and all the provisions
which they were able to take. In the meantime the
fight continued; although on our part but very
feebly, but with redoubled vigor by the victorious
enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The matches were then prepared, and the firemen
stood ready to burn the vessels. All was ready; and,
with the few men remaining with me, I got into the
boats. The enemy, on discovering our preparations
for debarking, naturally inferred our design of retreating,
and put all their infantry on the march, to
<a id='Page_129'></a>attack us. I was not disposed to meet them, with
such inequality of numbers and arms, and in the condition
of the enemy's infantry. Besides, an open
river was to be crossed. But the burning of the
vessels, by the Santa Barbara operation, blowing-up,
was performed in a terrible manner, and gave the
enemy clear notice of our movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scene presented by the burning flotilla was very
striking. The river lay as clear as crystal; and the
burning cinders fell on both its banks, while a terrible
noise of explosions was continually heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards evening, in our little boats, we approached
the River Espinillo, and encamped on its right bank.
During the voyage to Esquina, the first town in Corrientes,
we spent three days, proceeding very painfully
among islands and ponds, and reduced to one ration a
day, consisting of a single biscuit, without anything
else to eat. On reaching Esquina, our condition was
considerably improved; the wounded were placed
under shelter; and the men had meat in abundance.
The inhabitants, who were good Republicans, showed
us the greatest hospitality.</p>

<p class='c007'>We spent some months in the Province of Corrientes,
without the occurrence of anything important.
At length the Governor formed a plan to arm a
flotilla of small vessels; but succeeded in nothing but
losing time. I then received orders from Montevideo
to march to the scene of revolution in San Francisco,
in Uruguay, and place myself and my forces at the
<a id='Page_130'></a>disposition of General Rivera, who was stationed with
an army in that neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>I then traversed the entire territory of Corrientes,
from Santa Lucia to the Pass of Higos, on the Uruguay.
Going through the Pass, we arrived at San
Francisco, partly by the river and partly by land. At
the Falls I had the pleasure of meeting Anzani, then
transformed into a merchant. Having reached San
Francisco, I there found several vessels of war, of
which I took the command. General Rivera had
gone into Entre Rios, with the army, where the army
of Corrientes was to meet him, and go to attack that
of Ouribes. On the 6th of December, 1842, occurred,
at Arroyo Grande, the celebrated battle in which the
nation fought for their sacred rights; but the power
of a tyrant triumphed. Different circumstances led to
this result, which would require much time to give in
detail: but the chief cause was the discord fomented
by the ambition of a few, which plunged all into disaster,
and exposed them to extermination by an
implacable conqueror. Oh, virtuous and generous
people! The same fortune befel Italy at a later day,
which was suffered by the provinces of La Plata, and
brought about by the same cause, which was sent by
Heaven in wrath.</p>

<p class='c007'>At San Francisco, where I found General Aguiar
staying on account of his health, I remained only a
short time, when I received orders from him to collect
all the disposable forces, and a few hundred militia,
<a id='Page_131'></a>called Aguerridos, commanded by Colonel Guerra,
and march to the Pass of Vessilles, to coöperate
actively with the enemy. I reached that place with
the vessels, and there found the remains of the army's
residence, but not a single person. I sent scouts, to
search the surrounding country; but discovered
nothing! That day was the fatal sixth of December;
and every man had been called to the field of battle,
which was decided at the distance of eighteen miles
from the spot, on the bank of the Arroyo Grande.
There sometimes seems to be something in the depths
of our minds superior to understanding; at least so it
seemed to me on that occasion. Without pretending
to explain it, I thought I felt its effects; which,
although in a confused manner, seemed something like
looking into the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>On that day I felt a solemn impression on my heart,
mingled with bitterness, like the feelings of warriors
left languishing on a field of battle, and trampled on
by the insolent soldier, by the hoof of the war-horse of
the cruel, the implacable conqueror. Very few were
saved from that terrible battle; and the whole band,
with me, experienced feelings difficult to describe, indeed,
quite unspeakable. Sadness was mingled with
a prevailing presentiment of disaster. Not being able
to find any living being who could give information
of the army, and having no orders from General
Aguiar, I resolved to land all the troops, leaving only
a small number in the boats, and to march in search of
<a id='Page_132'></a>the army. It should be remarked, that I always
pursued my favorite system of the Rio Grande, and
never marched without a contingent of cavalry, taken
from my amphibious companions in misfortune, men
who had been thrown out of the cavalry of the army,
for some fault or perhaps some crime, but who fought
well, and whom I severely punished when they deserved
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although no human beings were to be found in that
region, we caught a number of horses which had been
abandoned, and obtained a sufficient supply for the
service. The abundance of horses in those countries
greatly facilitates such an operation. All things were
soon ready; and I was on the point of giving the
order for marching, when, well for me, an order was
received from General Aguiar, recalling me to San
Francisco. But for this, I and my troops would
doubtless have fallen victims: for the army was so
completely broken up on that day, that it would have
been impossible to find anything but the mere wreck
of it, while we must have met the victorious enemy,
from whom escape would have been very difficult, if
not impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The troops, therefore, reëmbarked, without the object
being known even to their commander, and without
obtaining any news whatever of the events of
the day. On reaching San Francisco, I received a
note from Colonel Esteves, beginning with the following
terrible words:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><a id='Page_133'></a>"<i>Our army has suffered a reverse!</i>"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>General Aguiar had marched along the left bank
of the Uruguay, to collect the fugitives, and requested
me to stay in San Francisco, to guard the great
quantity of materials of every kind remaining there.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the period which elapsed between the battle of
Arroyo Grande and the beginning of the siege of
Montevideo, that confusion prevailed which is common
in such cases, when plans are by turns formed, rejected,
and again adopted. Fear, desertion, and irresolution
existed; but they were found only in rare and individual
cases. The people stood firm and heroic, at
the voice of noble-hearted men, who proclaimed that
the Republic was in danger, and called upon all to
rise in its defence. In a short time there was a new
army, which, although neither so large nor so well disciplined
as the former, was, at least, more full of energy
and enthusiasm, and more strongly impressed with the
sacred cause which impelled them. It was no longer
the cause of a single man which stimulated the multitude:
the star of that man had sunk in the late battle,
and in vain endeavored again to rise. It was the
cause of the nation, in the presence of which personal
hatred and dissention were silenced. Foreigners were
preparing to invade the territory of the Republic; and
<a id='Page_135'></a>every citizen came out with arms and horses, to range
himself under the banner, to repel him. The danger
increased, and with it the zeal and devotion of that
generous people. Not a single voice was heard to
utter the word "submission," or "accommodation."
Since the battle of Novara, in Piedmont, I could never
compare my countrymen with the Montevideans without
blushing. However, all Italy desired not to submit to
foreign dominion, but panted for battle; and I am convinced
that Italians, like Montevideans, possess constancy
and generous devotion to liberty. But they
have so many and such powerful influences to keep
them enslaved!</p>

<p class='c007'>I had then orders to sink the small vessels in
the channel of the river, by which the enemy's fleet
could come up. The larger vessels of the patriot
flotilla were then not to be sunk, but to be burned; I
was therefore soon engaged in burning a third fleet,
but this was not to be done, as on the two former occasions,
while fighting, my sailors having, consequently,
once more been transformed into foot soldiers. I remained
with them a few days in San Francisco, to
allow time to ship for Montevideo the remaining
materials of the army; and we then set off on the
march for the capital, in the neighborhood of which
all the forces were to be collected. Little or nothing
of importance occurred on the journey, except my
acquaintance with General Pacheco, then a Colonel in
Mercedes. That illustrious Oriental commenced, at
<a id='Page_136'></a>that dangerous crisis, to display a noble superiority in
energy, courage, and capacity. He, beyond all question,
was the principal champion of the gigantic
struggle sustained by his country against foreign
invasion; a struggle which will serve as an example
to future generations, and to all nations who are not
willing to submit to force; and may God protect
the Oriental people!</p>

<p class='c007'>Montevideo presented, at that time, a surprising
spectacle. Ourives had conquered, and was advancing
at the head of an army, which had passed through
the Argentine provinces like a tempest, or rather like a
thunderbolt. At the Coriolano of Montevideo, neither
the prostrations of the priests would have availed, nor
the tears of wives or mothers, to soften the hearts of
the soldiers. The idea of chastising that city, which
had driven him away, and seen him fly, gratified the
soul of that atrocious man. The army of Montevideo
had been destroyed, and nothing of it remained except
small and disheartened fragments of forces, scattered
over the territory of the Republic. The squadrons
were cut in pieces, arms and ammunition were very
scarce, or entirely wanting, and the treasury! It is
only necessary to imagine it in the hands of such
men as Vidal, intent on nothing but on getting doubloons,
as the most portable kind of money for a
meditated flight. He was Minister General.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was, however, necessary to defend themselves.
There were many men belonging to Rivera's party for
<a id='Page_137'></a>whom there was no escape after the arrival of the others,
and for whom the defence was an indispensable condition.
But they were powerless and trembling, being
bound to their employments and property. Yet the
nation, the people, did not regard Ourives as the
antagonist of Rivera, but as the head of a foreign
army, which he led on for invasion, slavery and death;
and they ran to the defence with a feeling of their
rights. In a short time the army, in companies of
cavalry, was made new. An army, chiefly consisting
of infantry, was organized in Montevideo, to support
the capital, and under the auspices of that man of
victories, General Paz. That General Paz, whom envy,
but no good cause at all, had driven from the command,
replied to the call of his country in a time of danger,
appeared at the head of the forces of the capital, and
organized, with recruits and freemen, then emancipated
by the Republic, that army which, for seven years, was
the bulwark of the country, and still maintains itself
in the presence of the most powerful enemy in South
America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many leaders, forgotten and not fond of wars in
which only individual interests were engaged, made
their appearance in the files of the defenders, and
increased the enthusiasm and confidence of the troops.
A line of fortifications was to be drawn around the city
towards the accessible part from the country, and they
labored with alacrity until it was completed. Before the
enemy's approach, manufactories of arms and ammunition,
<a id='Page_138'></a>foundries of cannon, shops for making clothes
and accoutrements for soldiers, all sprang up at once,
as if by a miracle. Cannons, which, from the days of
the Spaniards, had been judged useless, and placed as
guards at the borders of the sidewalks in the streets,
were dug out and mounted for defence.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was appointed to organize a flotilla, for which
several small vessels were chosen. A favorable incident
proved very valuable to me, by enabling me to
commence that armament. The enemy's brig Oscar,
in sailing at night in the neighborhood of the coast,
ran upon the point of the Cerro. That is the name
of a mountain west of Montevideo, which forms, with
its base, the western side of the harbor. In spite of
every effort made by the enemy to get the vessel afloat,
they were obliged to abandon her. We profited much
by that shipwreck. From the first the enemy
endeavored to prevent our saving her, and sent the
sloop of war Palmar to cannonade us; but not obtaining
much advantage from this, and the Republicans
showing much obstinacy in seizing their prey, they
soon left them at liberty to pursue their work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the numerous objects removed from the
wreck, were five cannons, which served to arm three
small vessels, the first in the new flotilla, and which
were immediately put to use in covering the left flank
of the line of fortifications. I regarded the loss of the
Oscar as a good augury of the terrible defeat which
was preparing.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was now the 16th of February, 1843. The fortifications
of the city had hardly had time to be completed,
and to allow a few cannons to be placed, when
the enemy's army made its appearance on the surrounding
heights. General Rivera, at the head of the
cavalry, although not strong enough to be able to
fight them, had gone out and taken the field, turning
the left flank of the enemy, and placing himself in
their rear. That manœuvre, performed in a masterly
manner, placed him again in a state to carry on the
war with advantage. General Paz remained in command
of the forces in the capital, which were numerous
compared with the extent of wall which was to be
defended. If, however, we regard the materials of
which they were composed, who were raw recruits,
and the pernicious elements at work, they could not be
<a id='Page_140'></a>considered powerful. The constancy of the General,
however, was displayed to the utmost, who sustained
with them the first and most dangerous battles of the
siege; and notwithstanding the generous spirit displayed
by the people, there was no want of disturbers,
cowards, and traitors. Vidal, then the Minister-General,
had robbed the treasury, and run away.
Antuña, colonel of a corps, and head of the police,
deserted to the enemy, with many other civil and
military officers. A corps, called Aguerridos, composed
of foreigners hired by the Republic, in various
affairs, had almost entirely deserted; and one night,
when they occupied an advanced post, by their
treachery they greatly exposed the security of the
city. Such examples also were imitated by single individuals,
who, from various motives, abandoned the
files of the defenders, to pass over to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Affairs did not go on well at first. I never knew
why Ourives, who must have been well acquainted
with occurrences, did not take advantage of such distrust
and the bad state of the fortifications, to make a
vigorous attack upon the place. He did nothing but
make reconnaissances and false attacks by night. In
the meantime foreign legions were organized and
armed. In whatever way the spirit of the French and
Italian legions may be viewed, it must not be denied
that the first call to arms was answered by a generous
rising, to repel the invasion of their adopted country:
but afterwards individuals were introduced, whose
<a id='Page_141'></a>interested views were quite on the contrary side. The
organizing and arming of those corps, however, certainly
availed in securing the safety of the city. The
French, being more numerous and more excited by
military display, soon had two thousand six hundred
men under arms. The Italians assembled, in number
five hundred; and, although they might seem few in
proportion to the number in the country, and their
education, I was surprised at seeing so many, considering
their habits. They were afterwards increased,
but never exceeded seven hundred.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Paz, profiting by the increase of forces,
established an exterior line, at the distance of a cannon-shot
beyond the walls. From that time the system of
defence was settled, and the enemy were no more able
to approach the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>While I had charge of the flotilla, with the organizing
of which I was proceeding, Angelo Mancini
was placed in command of the legion—a man of infamous
memory; and he was accepted. The flotilla
performed its first service in a sortie; and, as might
be supposed, made no favorable figure. Italian bravery
was despised, and I consequently burned with
shame. The Legion was appointed to form part of an
expedition to the Cerro; and I was to accompany it.
General Bauza, an experienced and good soldier, but
an old man, had the command. He appeared in the
presence of the enemy, marching and counter-marching,
without accomplishing any effect. It was,
<a id='Page_142'></a>perhaps, prudent not to attack an enemy, who, if
not more numerous, were more experienced and warlike.
I endeavored to excite the veteran general, but
in vain, when fortune sent General Pacheco from
Montevideo, who was then Minister of War. His appearance
gratified me very much, as I knew him to be
an enterprising and brave man. We were soon
acquainted, and I was treated by the new chief with
confidence and familiarity. I requested leave to
drive the enemy from a position beyond a ditch,
which then served as a dividing line to the besiegers.
He not only assented, but ordered General Bauza to
support the movement of the Italian Legion. We
attacked the left wing of the enemy, who fearlessly
awaited us with a firm front and a terrible volley of
musketry. But the Italian Legion was victorious
that day. Although numbers fell wounded, their
comrades pressed on fearlessly, and at length charged
with bayonets, when the enemy fled, and were pursued
to a considerable distance. The centre and right
were also victorious, and took forty-two prisoners, besides
killed and wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>That action, although of little importance in itself,
was of very great value in its effects,—greatly strengthening
the spirit of the Republican army, and diminishing
that of the enemy, while it established, from
that day, the military character of the Italian Legion.
It was also the precursor of many great deeds performed
by that corps, which was never conquered.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_143'></a>The next day the Italian Legion was in the principal
square of the metropolis, in view of the whole
population, receiving the praises of the Minister of
War and the acclamations of all the people. The
impressive words of General Pacheco had resounded
among the multitude. I had never heard words more
adapted to rouse a nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Italian Legion had now fought for the first
time and by itself, and there was that same Captain
Giacomo Minuto who was afterwards captain of
cavalry in Rome, and there received a wound in the
breast from a ball, and died in consequence of loosening
the bandages at the news of the entrance of the
French.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major Pedro Rodriguez also displayed much bravery.</p>

<p class='c007'>From that day until the appearance of Anzani in
the Legion, I absented myself but little from the corps,
although engaged at sea most of the time. About
that period Anzani was at Buenos Ayres, where,
receiving an invitation from me, he came to Montevideo.
The acquisition of Anzani to the Legion was
extremely valuable, especially for instruction and discipline.
Although he was much opposed by Manceni
and by the second chief, who could not submit to
acknowledge his superior merit, being perfect in
military knowledge and direction, he systematized the
corps on as regular a footing as circumstances would
permit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flotilla, although of little importance, did not
<a id='Page_144'></a>fail to be worth something to the defence of the place.
Posted at the left extremity of the line of defence, it
not only effectually covered it, but threatened the
right flank of the enemy whenever it attempted an
attack. It served as a link between the important
position of the Cerro and the Island of Libertad, by
greatly facilitating and coöperating in the attempts
which were continually made upon the right of the
enemy, who were besieging the Cerro. The Island
of Libertad had been watched by the enemy, who laid
a plan to get possession of it. Their squadron, under
command of General Brown, was prepared to invade
it and gain possession. It was determined that
artillery should be placed upon it, and I transported
to it two cannon, eighteen pounders.</p>

<p class='c007'>About ten at night, that operation having been
performed, I left the island with a company of my
countrymen, and returned towards Montevideo. Then
happened one of those unforeseen and important events
which, I love to say, are evidently brought about by
the hand of Providence. The Island of Libertad,
placed in advance of the coast of the Cerro at the distance
of less than a cannon-shot, is less than three miles
from Montevideo. The wind blew from the South,
and caused some agitation of the sea in the bay in
proportion to its force, and especially in that passage
between the island and the mole. I had embarked in
a launch, purchased by the government, and had with
me sailors enough to perform the service just executed,
<a id='Page_145'></a>and the large lighter in tow, in which the artillery
had been transported. Between the waves rolling in
from the south and the weight of the boat, which was
also exactly square in shape, we proceeded slowly,
drifting considerably towards the north end of the
bay, when, all at once, several vessels of war were discovered
to the leeward, and so near that the sentinels
were heard calling to the men, "Keep quiet!" It was
doubtless the enemy's squadron.</p>

<p class='c007'>We wonderfully escaped being captured by them;
but the principal cause of our safety was, that the
small vessels and the boats of the enemy had gone to
attack the island, and there was nothing left that
could pursue us. If this had not been the case, we
should doubtless have been taken: but, more than
this, the enemy did not fire a shot, though they might
easily have sunk our little vessels, for fear of alarming
their troops who had gone to the island, to surprise it.
But what an escape it appeared to me when I reached
the mole, and began to hear a terrible discharge of
musketry on the Island of Libertad! I immediately
reported the proceedings to the government, and then
went on board my little vessels, to prepare them to go
in aid of the troops on the island. They were only
about sixty there, not well armed, and with but little
ammunition. I set sail at dawn of day, with only two
small vessels, called <i>yates</i>; the third, and only remaining
one of the flotilla, not being fit for use at that
time. We proceeded, and soon entered between the
<a id='Page_146'></a>island and the Cerro, uncertain whether the enemy had
got possession or not in their night attack. But the
brave Italians, although taken unexpectedly, had fought
with bravery, and had not only repulsed the enemy,
but driven them back with much loss; and the corpses
of Rosas' soldiers floated about in the waters of the
harbor several days after. Having sent a skiff to the
island to ascertain its fate, I soon received welcome
intelligence of the successful resistance. I speedily
landed the munitions, and one of my officers with some
men to serve the guns; and this had hardly been
accomplished when the enemy opened their fire, and the
island replied with its two cannon. I then, with my
two boats, got to windward of the enemy's vessels, and
did all I could against them. But the combat was
unequal in the extreme. I had against me two
brigantines and two schooners, and one of the former
had sixteen guns. The cannons on the island had
platforms, and were ill-supplied with ammunition, and
therefore did not fire well, or produce much effect.
Had they been better provided for, they might have
done good service. Although the sea was not very
rough, it was sufficiently so to prevent the guns of my
two little vessels from firing with precision; and, in
short, it seemed impossible that the engagement could
fail to be to the enemy successful. But once more God
provided for us!</p>

<p class='c007'>Commodore Purvis, then commander of the British
station at Montevideo, sent a messenger to Brown, on
<a id='Page_147'></a>account of which he ceased firing. From that moment
the affairs turned to negotiation. The enemy's squadron
left the harbor, and the island did not again fall
into the power of another. Whatever the reasons of
the Commodore may have been, it is undeniable that
some degree of chivalrous generosity towards an unfortunate
but courageous people entered into the
sympathies and into the act of the philanthropic son
of Albion. From that moment Montevideo knew that
she had in the English Commodore not only a friend,
but a protector.</p>

—TRES CRUCES—THE PASS OF BOJADA—THE QUADRADO—GENERAL

EXPEDITION IN THE URUGUAY, THE FLOTILLA BEING
UNDER MY COMMAND.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>The affair of the island increased the fame and importance
of the arms of the Republic, although its
favorable result was more due to fortune than to anything
else, and although nothing more was gained by
defending it. Thus it was, that by insignificant, or at
least small but successful enterprizes, a cause was fostered
and raised up, which had been considered by
many as desperate. A patriotic and excellent administration
of the government, at the head of which was
Pacheco; the management of the war by the incomparable
General Paz; the fearless and powerful support
given by the people, then purged from their few
traitors and cowards; and the arming of the foreign
Legions,—in short, everything promised a happy result.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Italian Legion, whose formation was ridiculed
by some, and especially by the French, had now acquired
so much fame, that they were envied by the best
troops. They had never been beaten, though they had
<a id='Page_149'></a>shared in the most difficult enterprizes and most arduous
battles.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Tres Cruces, (the Three Crosses,) where the fearless
Colonel Neva, from an excess of courage, had
fallen within the enemy's lines, the Legion sustained
one of those Homeric battles described in history,
fighting hand to hand, and driving the troops of Ourives
from their strongest positions, until they brought
away the dead body of the chief of the line. The
losses of the Legion on that day were considerable,
compared with their small numbers, but on that account
they gained more honor. That success, which
seemed as if it might exhaust it, on the contrary fostered
it exceedingly. It grew in numbers, with new
recruits, soldiers of a day, but who fought like veterans!
Such is the Italian soldier; such are the sons of
the despised nation, when struck with the generous
idea of what is noble.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the Pass of the Bajada, on the 24th of April, was
one of the most serious conflicts. A corps of the army
under the command of General Paz, had marched out
from Montevideo, passed by the right wing of the enemy,
proceeded along the shore of the north bend of the
bay to Pantanoso, where, joining the Republican forces
of the Cerro, he intended to make a decisive blow on
the enemy's army,—who were thus drawn out of their
strong positions of the Cerrito,—to surprise two battalions,
stationed on the shores of that marshy little
stream. As that operation was not successful
<a id='Page_150'></a>in consequence of a want of concert, they were obliged
to go through the Pass, involved in a very sharp
action. Of the two divisions comprising the corps,
which were about seven thousand, that which formed
the rearguard was so much pressed by the enemy,
that, when recovered from surprise, they endeavored
to regain their ground. This they would have saved
with the greatest possible effort, in consequence
of the extreme difficulty of the place. I commanded
the division of the centre; and the general ordered
me to re-pass and support the troops in that
danger. I obeyed, but, to my surprise, found the battle
a desperate one. The Republicans were fighting
bravely: but the enemy had surrounded them, and
then occupied a very strong salting establishment,
(called Saladero,) between us and the rearguard, who
had exhausted their ammunition. The head of the Italian
column entered the Saladero, just when the head
of one of the enemy's columns had entered. Then
commenced a very warm contest, hand to hand; and
finally Italian bravery triumphed. At that place the
ground was encumbered with dead bodies; but my
friends were safe, and the fight proceeded, with advantage
to our side. Other corps came in to support
them, and the retreat was effected in admirable order.
The French Legion, on that day, going to operate
simultaneously on the line of the city, was defeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 28th of March, however, was highly honorable
to the Republican arms, and to the Italian Legion.
<a id='Page_151'></a>The movement was directed by General Pacheco. The
enemy were besieging the Cerro, under the orders of
General Nuñez, who had shamefully deserted to the
enemy's files, in the beginning of the siege. They
showed much boldness, and several times came up
under the heavy ramparts of the fortress, threatening
to cut off the communications with the city and
destroying with musket shots the light-house erected on
the upper part of the edifices. General Pacheco ordered
several corps to be transported to the Cerro,
among which was the Italian Legion. That movement
took place during the night; and at the first light
it was in ambush in a powder manufactory, half a mile
from the battery. That edifice, although in ruins, had
the walls standing, and afforded sufficient space to contain
the entire Italian Legion, though in a somewhat
confined situation. Skirmishing was commenced, and
afterwards something more serious. The enemy stood
boldly against their opponents, and got possession of
a strong position called the <i>Quadrado</i>, or the Square,
at the distance of a short cannon-shot from the
Powder-house. A number of men had already been
wounded among the Republicans, and, among others,
Colonel Cajes and Estivao, in my opinion the best of
the officers. Such was the state of things, when the
signal was given for the Legion to make a sortie, and
the conflict became serious, under the command of
Colonel Carceres, who had charge of the force engaged.
I shall always feel proud of having belonged
<a id='Page_152'></a>to that handful of brave men, having always seen them
on the high road of victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was proposed to attack the enemy on an eminence,
behind the shelter of a ditch and parapet. The
space which it was necessary to pass, in order to
assault it, was unobstructed by any obstacle, and therefore
the enterprise was by no means an easy one. But
the Legion, that day, would have faced fiends, if they
could have been conjured upon the field; and they
marched on against the enemy, without firing a shot
and without hesitating for a moment, except to throw
themselves into the Pantanoso, three miles distant from
the field of battle. Nuñez was killed, and many
prisoners were taken. The Oriental corps, in company
with the Italians, fought very bravely; and, though
the above-mentioned movement was somewhat retarded,
the order was given to the column on the right to
advance and place itself between the river and the
enemy. And certainly not one of the enemy's infantry
was saved.</p>

<p class='c007'>That battle reflects great honor on the skill of
General Pacheco.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the first years of the siege of Montevideo,
the Italian Legion sustained innumerable conflicts.
They suffered the loss of many killed and wounded;
but in no engagement did they disgrace themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Rivera was defeated at India Muerta; but
the capital was not conquered with him. The corps
belonging to it were trained to war by daily fighting,
<a id='Page_153'></a>and also gained moral advantage over the besiegers.
The English and French intervention took place, and
then all parties anticipated a happy result of the war.</p>

<p class='c007'>A project for operations, combined by the government
and the admirals of the two allied nations, was
an expedition in the Uruguay; and it was placed
under my command. In the period now past, the
national flotilla had been increased by the addition of
several vessels, some of which were chartered, like the
first, and others sequestrated from certain enemies of
the Republic, and others still were prizes made from
the enemy, who sent their vessels to the Bucco and
other places on the coast in possession of the forces of
Ourives. Then, between the acquisition of the above-mentioned
vessels, and of two others of the Argentine
squadron, sequestered by the English and French, and
placed at the disposition of the Oriental government,
the expedition for the Uruguay was composed of about
fifteen vessels, the largest of which was the Cagancha,
a brig of sixteen guns, and the smallest were several
boats.</p>

<p class='c007'>The landing corps was thus composed: the Italian
Legion of about two hundred men, about two hundred
Nationals, under command of Colonel Battle, and
about a hundred cavalry, with two four pounders and
six horses in all.</p>

<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>THE EXPEDITION PROCEEDS FOR THE URUGUAY—COLONIA
TAKEN BY IT—BURNED—PAGE, A SUSPICIOUS FRENCHMAN—MARTIN
GARCIA TAKEN.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>It was near the close of the year 1845 when the expedition
left Montevideo for the Uruguay, beginning an
honorable campaign with brilliant but fruitless results,
for the generous but unfortunate Oriental nation.
We arrived at Colonia, where the English and French
squadrons were awaiting us, to assail the city. It
was not a very arduous enterprise, under the protection
of the superfluous guns of the vessels. I landed
with my Legionaries; and the enemy opposed no resistance
under the walls: but, on getting outside of them,
they were found ready for battle. The allies then
debarked, and requested their commanders to support
me in driving the enemy away. A force of each of
the two nations accordingly came out for my assistance.
But the Italians had hardly begun to fight, and obtained
some advantage, when the allies retired within the city
walls. The reason for this unexpected movement was
never explained to me; but I was compelled to follow
their example, in consequence of the great inferiority
of my force compared with that of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_155'></a>When the other party proposed to abandon the city,
they obliged the inhabitants to evacuate it, and then
endeavored to give it to the flames. From that time,
therefore, many of the houses presented the sad spectacle
of the effects of conflagration, the furniture
having been broken, and everything lying in confusion.
When the Legion landed, and the Nationals, they had
immediately followed the enemy who were retreating;
and the allies, landing afterwards, occupied the empty
city, sending out a part of their forces to support
them. Now it was difficult, between the obstacles presented
by the ruins and the fire, to maintain the discipline
necessary to prevent some depredations; and
the English and French soldiers, in spite of the severe
injunctions of the Admirals, did not fail to take the
clothes which were scattered about the streets and in
the deserted houses. The Italians followed their
example, and, in spite of every exertion made by me and
my officers to prevent them, some of them persisted in
the work for a time; and I have the mortification of
acknowledging that I did not entirely succeed in my
efforts to prevent them. The most important articles
taken by the Italians, however, were eatables; and this
afforded some consolation, as the fact was less discreditable
to my countrymen than if they had chosen
objects of lasting pecuniary value. I feel also most
confident in saying, that nothing of that disgraceful
conduct would have happened, but for the beginning
made by the allied troops.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_156'></a>A Frenchman, named Page, who then resided in
Montevideo, published a description of the scene of
plunder. It was said by his contemporaries, that Page
was a creature of Guizot, sent out as a fiscal, and to
take account of what happened. I could not ascertain
whether he was a diplomatic spy or not. It is certain
that, in consequence of the French sympathy, I was
obliged, on landing on the shore of Colonia, to send
the men below, as their ship was thundering, with its
cannon well pointed towards us. We had several men
wounded, receiving contusions from splinters and fragments
of rock. Besides, Page's <i>elegant</i> "Narrative
of Facts," as he entitled a report which he published,
called the Italian Legion "Condoltreri," a term of contempt,
in his opinion, but which they were farthest
from deserving.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Colonia I and my troops might have coöperated
in an attack on the city; but they were sent elsewhere,
to restore the authority of the Republic on the banks
of the Uruguay. The Island of Martin Garcia, where
I arrived before Anzani with a small force, yielded
without resistance. There I obtained a number of oxen
and a few horses.</p>

HIS HABITS AND CHARACTER—ANOTHER MARTRERO, JUAN DE
LA CRUZ—THE RIO NEGRO—JOSEPH MUNDELL—THE SEVERITY
OF THE ENEMY DROVE THE MARTREROS AND PEOPLE TO US.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>At Colonia I met with the first "Martrero" I ever
saw. He was named Sivoriña, and was one of the remarkable
men known by that title who belonged to the
patriot party. The services of that class of brave adventurers
were of great value to that expedition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The "Martrero" is a type of independent man. One
of them often rules over an immense extent of country
in that part of South America, with the authority of
a government, yet without laying taxes, or raising
tribute: but he asks and receives from the inhabitants
their good will, and what is needful to his wandering
life. He demands nothing but what is necessary; and
his wants are limited. A good horse is the first element
of a Martrero. His arms, usually consisting of
a carbine, a pistol, a sword, and his knife, which are
his inseparable companions, are things without which
he would think he could not exist. If it is considered
that from the ox he obtains the furniture of his saddle;
the "<i>Mancador</i>," with which to bind his companion to
<a id='Page_158'></a>the pasture; "<i>Mancas</i>," to accustom him to remaining
bound and not to stray; the "<i>Bolas</i>," which stop the
<i>bagual</i>, or wild horse, in the midst of his fury, and
throw him down, by entangling his legs: the "<i>Lazo</i>,"
not the least useful of his auxiliaries, and which hangs
perennially on the right haunch of his steed; and
finally the meat, which is the only food of the Martrero;—if
all these are borne in mind, in the forming
and use of which the knife is indispensable, some idea
may be conceived of how much he counts on that instrument,
which he also employs, with wonderful dexterity,
in wounding and cutting the throat of his enemy.
The Martrero is the same as the <i>Gaucho</i> of the
Pampas, and the <i>Monarco de la cuchilla</i>, (<i>Monarch of
the Knife</i>,) of the Rio Grande, but more free and independent.
He will obey, when the system of government
is conformed to his own opinions and sympathies.
The field and the wood are his halls; and the ground
is his bed. To him little appears sufficient. When he
enters his house, the Martrero there finds one who truly
loves him, and shares with him his toils and dangers,
with courage and fortitude equal to his own. Woman
as the more perfect being, appears to me to be naturally
more adventurous and chivalrous than man; and
the servile education to which in that country she is
condemned, probably prevents the examples from being
more common.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vivoriña was the first of the Martreros who joined
my troops: but he was not the best. On the banks of
<a id='Page_159'></a>the channel of Inferno, the eastern one, between the
island of Martin Garcia and the continent, he had
seized a boat, and put his pistol to the breast of its
master, and compelled him to transport him to the Island,
whither he came and presented himself to me.
Many other Martreros afterwards came in, and rendered
much service in the ulterior operations; but the man
on whom I love to bestow a high title, and who joined
to the courage and audacity of a Martrero, the valor,
integrity and coolness of a good captain, was Juan de
la Cruz Ledesma, of whom mention will often be
made in this narrative.</p>

<p class='c007'>Juan de la Cruz, with his black head-dress, his eagle
eyes, noble mien, and beautiful person, was my intrepid
and faithful companion in that Uruguay expedition,
which I consider the most brilliant in which I was
ever engaged; and he, and Joseph Mundell, equally
brave and better educated, are impressed upon my
mind for life.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Colonia were assembled Colonel Battle, and the
Nationals of the garrison. In Martin Garcia we had
left some men, and raised the Republican standard.
The expedition then continued the voyage along the
river. Anzani had the vanguard, with some of the
smaller vessels, and took possession of a number of
merchantmen under the enemy's flag. We thus reached
the Yaguary, a confluent of the Rio Negro with
the Uruguay.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rio Negro, which empties into the Uruguay at
<a id='Page_160'></a>that place, forms several islands of considerable size,
covered with woods and pasture-grounds in ordinary
times; but in winter, when the rivers are swollen by
the rains, they are almost entirely flooded, so that only
animals are able to live there. The troops, however,
found enough oxen and some wild horses. The greatest
benefit to the expedition there was the landing of the
horses, and allowing them relief from the evils of the
voyage. Beyond those islands towards the east, and
bathed by the Rio Negro on the south, by the Uruguay
on the north, is the <i>Rincon de las Gallinas</i>. This is a
part of the main land, of considerable extent, joined
to the neighboring country by an Isthmus; and it
abounded with an immense number of animals, of various
kinds, not excepting horses. It was, therefore,
one of the favorite spots of the Martreros. One of my
first cares was to march, with a part of the landing
force, and take a position on the shore of the Rincon,
from which I sent out Vivoriña, with Miranda, one
of his companions, on horseback. They soon met with
several of the Martreros of the place, who joined the
expedition, and were soon followed by others; and,
from that time, a beginning was made in forming a
body of cavalry, which increased very fast. Meat was
abundant; and in that same night an operation was
undertaken against a party of the enemy, which had
the most successful issue. A Lieutenant Gallegos, who
had accompanied the troops from Montevideo, was intrusted
with the command. He surprised the enemy, in
<a id='Page_161'></a>number about twenty; but few were able to escape,
and he brought in six prisoners, some of whom were
wounded. The affair gained for us several horses,
which were a very important acquisition in our circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>The system adopted by the enemy was, to send the
inhabitants into the interior, in order to cut off their
communications with the troops; and this induced
many of those unfortunate people to join us, among
whom they found a kind reception and a safe retreat,
in the largest of the islands, to which the soldiers carried
a great number of animals, and chiefly sheep, for
their subsistence. Thus, in different ways, the expedition
gained strength and was favored by circumstances,
especially by the arrival of Juan de la Cruz,
whose discovery deserves to be mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Martreros of the Rincon, who were assembled
with me at the time, informed me that Juan de la Cruz,
at the head of a few parties of his friends, had fought
several bands of the enemy on previous days; but,
overcome by numbers, had been obliged to scatter his
men, and take to the woods alone, in the thickest bushes,
and even to abandon his horse, and to set off in a canoe,
for the most obscure islands of the Uruguay.
There he was still an object of the chief persecution
to the enemy, who, after the battle of India Muerta,
when there were no longer any national corps in the
country, could pursue the Martreros at their pleasure.
In such a painful situation was he found at that time;
<a id='Page_162'></a>and I intrusted one Saldana, an old companion of Juan
de la Cruz, with a few Martreros, to visit his retreat
and bring him away. The undertaking was successful;
and after a few days spent in the search, they found
him, on an island, in a tree, and his canoe tied at its
root, floating in the water, it being the time of inundation,
and the little island being flooded. He had so
placed himself that he could at once have retreated
into the woods, if enemies had appeared, instead of
friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young Italians in the expedition at that time,
learned a lesson of the life they will be called to lead,
when they shall see their country redeemed. Juan de
la Cruz was an important acquisition to the expedition.
From that day forward, we had with us all the Martreros
of the surrounding district, and a force of excellent
cavalry, without which little or nothing could have
been undertaken in those countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Isla del Biscaino, (or the Island of the Biscayan,)
the largest in the Yaguary, soon became a colony,
peopled by the families which fled from the barbarity
of the enemy, and various others, from the capital.
Many animals were sent over to it, a number of
horses were left there, and an officer was entrusted
with the care of everything.</p>

<p class='c006'>The expedition then proceeded by the river, and
arrived at a place on its banks named Fray Bento,
where the vessels cast anchor. About eight miles
below, on the opposite bank, in the Province of Entre
Rios, is the mouth of the River Gualeguayechu. The
place is distant about six miles from its mouth. That
province belonged to the enemy. The expedition was
in want of horses for the operation; and good ones
were to be found in that region, as well as materials
needed to make clothing for the troops, and other
necessary articles, with which the province was well
provided. An expedition was therefore formed, to
obtain supplies. I went up the river further, expressly
for the purpose of preventing suspicion; and then, in
the night, the small vessels and boats embarked the
Italian Legionaries, and the cavalry with a few horses,
and proceeded towards the landing-place. At the
mouth of the little river lived a family, and it was
<a id='Page_164'></a>known that several merchant vessels and a small war-vessel
were there, which it was necessary to surprise;
and this was effected. The troops were so successful,
that they reached the very house of the commandant
of Gualeguayechu, while he was asleep in his bed.
The Colonel commandant of the country was named
Villagra. All the authorities, with the National
Guards, were soon in our hands; and we garrisoned
the strongest places with Republican troops. The
expedition then proceeded to recruit horses and obtain
other things of the most importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>We obtained many excellent horses in Gualeguayechu,
with articles necessary to clothe the men, harnesses
for the cavalry, and some money, which was
distributed among the sailors and soldiers. All the
prisoners were released at our departure. A party
of the enemy's cavalry, in garrison in the town, were
found to be absent, on the arrival of the expedition,
and returned during our stay. Being seen by the
sentinels, a few of the best mounted and equipped of
the cavalry were sent out, and an encounter took
place, in which the enemy were repulsed. This little
affair greatly encouraged the Republicans, especially
as it took place in view of all. We had one man
badly wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the mouth of the river was a peninsula, formed
by it and a small stream, and there was the residence
of the family before mentioned. The infantry embarked
in the small vessels in which they had sailed;
<a id='Page_165'></a>the cavalry marched by land to the peninsula, leading
the horses they had taken; and there they again remained.
The labor of embarking and disembarking
horses was not new to them; and in a few days everything
was carried away—some to the island of the
Biscaino, and some to the other island in the upper
part of the river, to serve in future operations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The expedition then proceeded into the interior, as
far as Paysandù, with the occurrence of little or
nothing worthy of notice. In that city was a large
guard, and the enemy had constructed some batteries
and sunk a number of vessels, in different parts of the
channel of the river, to obstruct the passage. All
obstacles were overcome; and a few shot in the vessels,
and a few wounded men, were the only consequences
of a heavy cannonade with the batteries.
Two officers deserved my particular notice: one a
Frenchman, and the other an Englishman, who commanded
two small vessels of war of their nations, and
accompanied me in almost the whole of that expedition,
although their instructions were not to fight.
The English Lieutenant was named Tench; and he
remained but a short time; the French officer was
Hypolite Marier, commander of the schooner L'Eclair.
The latter was with me the whole time, and became
very dear to me, being an officer of great merit.</p>

<p class='c007'>We reached Hervidero, formerly a most beautiful
establishment, then abandoned and deserted, but still
very rich in animals, which were highly valuable to the
<a id='Page_166'></a>expedition all the time of our stay. That point of
the Uruguay was named Hervidero, from the Spanish
word Hervir, which means <i>to boil</i>; and indeed it
looks like a boiling cauldron under all circumstances,
but especially when the river is low, abounding in
whirlpools formed by the numerous rocks lying under
water, over which a very rapid current pours all the
year. The passage is very dangerous. A very
spacious house stands on an eminence, built with a
terrace on the roof, called Azotea, and overlooks all
the left bank of the river. Around it was a multitude
of <i>Ranchos</i>, or barracks, with roofs of straw, which
attested the great number of slaves possessed by the
masters in more quiet times. When I first approached
the house, I found herds of the <i>Ganado manso</i>, or
domestic oxen, near the deserted habitations, in search
of their exiled masters; and with them a <i>majada</i>, or
flock of sheep, amounting to about forty thousand,
while the <i>ganado cuero</i> or <i>alzado</i>,—that is, the wild
cattle,—of about the same number, were scattered over
the fields. Besides these there were innumerable
horses, ginetes and Poledres, chiefly wild, and many
quadrupeds of various kinds. These few lines may
give some idea of the aspect of that kind of immense
estates in South America, called <i>Estancias</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hervidero, however, a <i>Saladero</i>, or place for
salting meat for exportation, as well as for preparing
hides, tallow, and, in short, everything furnished by the
animals slaughtered in their country. The depth of
<a id='Page_167'></a>the river did not permit them to take any other in
larger vessels. Anzani, with the infantry, lodged in
the establishment, occupying it in a military manner.
The measures taken were very useful in repressing an
unexpected attack, arranged between the enemies of
Entre Rios, under the command of General Garzon,
and those of the Oriental State, under Colonel Lavalleja.
That was undertaken while I was not at the
Hervidero.</p>

<p class='c007'>And, in the first place, as for the reason of my
absence. Among the cares of Juan de la Cruz, was that
of sending some of his martreros to inform the others,
who were scattered along the left bank of the river,
and those of the Gueguay, who were quite numerous.
A certain Magellano, and one José Dominguez were
among the most famous of them all. They were then
in the neighborhood of the Gueguay. José Mundell
had come to that country when a child, and had
become identified with the inhabitants and accustomed
to their habits. He had a present of an estancia, one
of the best in that part of the country. Mundell was
one of those privileged persons, who seem to have
come into the world to govern all around them. With
nothing extraordinary in his physical nature, he was
strong and active, "a free cavalier," and of a most
generous disposition; he had gained the hearts of all,
on whom he bestowed benefits whenever they were in
want, thus securing their love and tempering their
natures. He was above all things adventurous. It
<a id='Page_168'></a>may be added that Mundell, although he had spent
the most of his life in the desert, had, from his own
taste, cultivated his mind and acquired by study more
than an ordinary share of information. He had never
taken any part in political affairs, beyond those connected
with the choice of men for the Presidency, etc.
But when the foreigners, under the orders of Ourives,
invaded the territory of the Republic, he regarded
indifference as a crime, and threw himself into the
ranks of the defenders. With the influence which he
had acquired among his brave neighbors, he soon collected
several hundred men, and then sent me word
that he was going to join me with them. The bold
fellows, commanded by Juan de la Cruz, had brought
in that news to the Hervidero; and I immediately
resolved to meet with Mundell in the Arroyo Malo,
about thirty miles below the Salto, or Falls. On the
first night after my departure the attack was made on
the Hervidero. Hearing the cannon and musketry
while I was near Arroyo Malo, I was thrown into the
greatest anxiety, as was very natural; but I confided
much in the capacity of Anzani, whom I had left in
charge of everything.</p>

<p class='c007'>The attack on the Hervidero had been conceived
and planned in such a manner that, if the execution
had corresponded, its results must have been fatal.
Garzon, whose forces were not fewer than two
thousand men, most of them infantry, was to have
approached the right bank of the river, while Lavalleja
<a id='Page_169'></a>was to attack the Hervidero. In order that they
might strike at the same moment, they had placed two
fireships in the Yuy, a small river of Entre Rios, a few
miles above, intended, if not to burn the flotilla, at
least to occupy the sailors, and render it impossible
for them to give any assistance by land. The courage
and coolness of Anzani, and the bravery of the troops,
rendered all the efforts of the active enemy unavailing.
Garzon effected nothing by his steady fire of musketry,
because it was too distant, and the side of the river's
bank was commanded by the cannon of the flotilla,
which opened upon it. The fireships, being abandoned
to the current, passed at a distance from the vessels,
and were destroyed by their guns. Lavalleja pressed
his troops against the brave Legionaries in vain, they
being intrenched in the buildings, and terrifying the
enemy with their silence and proud resistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anzani had given orders that not a musket should
be fired, until the enemy were near enough to have
their clothes burnt by the powder; and this plan
succeeded well, for, supposing the houses to have been
evacuated, they advanced without apprehension: but
a general discharge of musketry, when close at hand,
from all quarters, put them immediately to flight, making
it impossible to rally again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having arranged with Mundell about his entering
Salto when occupied by the Republicans, I returned
to the Hervidero. I received notice, about that time,
from Colonel Baez, who was making arrangements to
<a id='Page_170'></a>join me with some men. The only vessel of the enemy
stationed in the Yuy deserted to us, with a portion of
the crew.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus everything smiled on the expedition.</p>

<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>THE PROVINCE OF CORRIENTES CALLS GENERAL PAZ FROM
MONTEVIDEO—ALLIANCE WITH PARAGUAY—I GO TO SALTO
WITH THE FLOTILLA, TO RELIEVE IT FROM A SIEGE—WITH LA
CRUZ AND MUNDELL, ATTACK LAVALLEJA—RETURN TO SALTO.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>The Province of Corrientes, after the battle of Arroyo
Grande, had fallen again under the dominion of Rosas:
but the admirable resistance of Montevideo, and some
other favorable circumstances, called the people again
to independence; and Madariaga and the principal
authorities in that revolution had invited General Paz
from Montevideo, to take command of the army.
That old and virtuous chief, by his own fame and
capacity, induced Paraguay to make an offensive and
defensive alliance; and that state collected at Corrientes
a respectable contingent for the army. Things
thus proceeded wonderfully well for that part of the
country; and not the least important object was the
opening of communications with those interior provinces,
to collect in the Department of Salto the Oriental
emigrants who were in Corrientes and Brazil. I
then sent from the Hervidero a <i>balenera</i>, on a mission
to General Paz: but, being observed and pursued by
the enemy, the men in it were obliged to abandon the
<a id='Page_172'></a>boat, and take refuge in the woods. I was obliged to
repeat the same thing three times; when at length a
brave officer of the Italians, Giacomo Casella, taking
advantage of a strong flood in the river, succeeded in
overcoming every obstacle, and arrived in the Province
of Corrientes. During the same flood I arrived at
Salto with the flotilla.</p>

<p class='c007'>The city was governed by Lavalleja, who attacked
the Hervidero with a force of about three hundred
men, infantry and cavalry. He had been engaged for
some days in making the inhabitants evacuate the
town; and for them and his troops he formed a camp
on the left bank of the Capebi, at the distance of
twenty-one miles from Salto.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Republicans took the town, without any resistance,
and designed to make some fortifications. That
point being occupied, they remained there, but, of
course, besieged on the land-side, as the enemy were
superior in cavalry. One of the principal inconveniences
which they suffered was the want of meat,
all the animals having been driven away. But that
evil did not last long.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mundell, having collected about a hundred and fifty
men, drove back a corps of the enemy who were pressing
upon him, and arrived safe at Salto. From that
moment the Republicans began to make sorties, and to
bring in animals enough for the subsistence of the
troops. With Mundell's horsemen, and those of Juan
de la Cruz, we were able to take the field; and one
<a id='Page_173'></a>fine day we went to seek Lavalleja in his own camp.
Some deserters from the enemy had given me exact
information of his position and the number of his
forces; and I determined to attack him. One evening
I drew out two hundred of the cavalry and a hundred
of the Italian Legionaries, and moved from Salto,
intending to surprise the enemy before daybreak. My
guides were the deserters; and, although they were
acquainted with the country, yet, as there were no
roads leading in the direction they took, they got
astray, and daylight found us at the distance of
three miles from the camp we were seeking. Perhaps
it was not prudent to attack an enemy at least
equal in force, entrenched, and in their own camp, and
which might receive reinforcements, which they had
asked for, at any moment; but to turn back would not
only have been disgraceful, but would have had
a very bad effect on the feelings of the new troops.
I was a little troubled by the idea of retreating,
and determined to attack. I reached an eminence
where the enemy had an advance post. They retired on
my approach. I could then see their camp, and observed
several groups returning towards it, from various
directions. They were detachments which had been
sent out in the night to different points, to observe the
Republicans, the enemy having heard of our setting
out. I then immediately gave orders to Mundell, who
had the vanguard, to press on a strong body of cavalry,
to prevent their concentration.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_174'></a>The enemy did the same, to repel that movement and
protect their troops. Mundell, with great bravery, succeeded,
and drove and dispersed several of their detachments;
but he advanced too far, in the warmth of
the pursuit, so that his troops soon found themselves
surrounded by the enemy, who, recovering from their
first fright, came upon them with their lances, threatening
to separate them from the main body, which, although
at a distance, was approaching for a battle. In
the meantime, seeing all this, I at first designed to have
the whole little force of the Republicans proceed in a
mass, and give a decisive blow. I therefore hastened
the march of the infantry, forming the rear guard and
reserve, with the cavalry of Juan de la Cruz: but
seeing the position of Mundell, which admitted no
delay, I left the infantry behind under the command of
Marrocchetti, and pressed forward the reserve of cavalry
in échellons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first échellon, commanded by Gallegas, pushed
on, and somewhat restored the resistance of the cavalry.
The charge of Juan de la Cruz drove the enemy back;
and they retired towards their camp. I had ordered
the échellons of the reserve to charge in a compact
mass, so that Mundell and his men, who had fought
bravely, might recover their order in a moment. Our
troops then moved on towards the enemy's camp, in
order of battle,—the infantry in the centre by platoons,
and under orders not to fire a shot; Mundell on the
<a id='Page_175'></a>right, and Juan de la Cruz on the left; while a small
échellon of cavalry formed a reserve.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy's cavalry, after the first encounter, had
formed again behind the infantry, who were covered
by a line of carts; but the firmness and resolution of
the Republicans, now marching on in a close body and
in silence, intimidated them so much that they made but
little resistance. In a moment the action was over;
or, rather, it was not a fight, but a complete discomfiture
and precipitate flight towards the pass of the river.
On reaching that point some of the boldest endeavored
to make a stand; and they might have been able, but
it would have been a very arduous task; although the
Republican cavalry had halted: for the Legionaries, at
the command of "Cartridges on the neck!" threw
themselves into the water with the greatest fury, and
there was no more resistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The victory was now complete. All the infantry of
the enemy were in the power of the conquerors, and some
of the cavalry, with all the families of the Salto, who
had been dragged from their homes, and a train containing
various objects of merchandize, consisting of thirty-four
loaded wagons. Above all, we had captured a
great number of horses, which were the most valuable
of all things in our existing circumstances. A brass
cannon, made in Florence, some ages past, by a certain
Cenni, fell into our hands. It was the same piece
which had been fired upon us at the Hervidero; and
<a id='Page_176'></a>being dismounted on that occasion, was undergoing
repair in the enemy's camp. After the action, which
lasted only a few hours, we collected everything useful,
and set off on our return. Our progress to Salto
was quite a triumphal march. The population poured
blessings on us from their own houses, to which they
had been restored by our means; and the victory acquired
for the army a reputation which was well merited,
proving that all the three classes of troops were
able to keep the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our celerity was of much importance; for, as has
already been mentioned, the enemy were in expectation
of a strong reinforcement; and that was the entire
force of General Urquiza, which had just before
been victorious at India Muerta, and was then on the
march for Corrientes, to fight the army of that province.
Vergara, who had the vanguard of it, came in
sight of Salto the day after our return, and captured
a few of our horses, which were dispersed in the neighboring
pastures. Being in the presence of those forces,
which seemed to overwhelm us, we made every exertion
to resist it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A battery, marked out by Anzani, in the centre of
the city, made a progress that was quite astonishing.
Both soldiers and people worked at it, such houses as
were adapted to defence were fortified, and every man
had a post assigned him. Several cannon were levelled
from the boats, and preparations were made to
<a id='Page_177'></a>supply the battery. At that time arrived Colonel Baez,
with about sixty cavalry. Urquiza soon after presented
himself, who had assured his friends that he
would cross the Uruguay at Salto, with the assistance
of the Republican flotilla, which he expected
to capture. But his prediction was not fulfilled. The
attack by the enemy was simultaneous with his appearance.</p>

DEFENCES INCOMPLETE—A SUDDEN ATTACK—REPULSED
SORTIES—BOLD OPERATION ON THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE
RIVER—SURPRISING FEATS OF THE HORSEMEN—THEIR HABITS.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>On the east of Salto was a hill, distant a musket shot
from the first houses; and it commanded the whole
town. The Republicans had not fortified it, for the
want of sufficient force, as it would be necessary, if
occupied, to establish a line of fortifications proportioned
to the number of disposable troops. As might
have been expected, Urquiza took possession of the
hill, and placed on it six pieces of artillery. At the
same time he sent forward his infantry, at quick step,
against the Republican right. Just at that moment
two pieces had been placed in the battery: but there
was yet neither platform nor parapet; and the enemy,
after giving their fire, threw themselves upon the
ground, which was not even consolidated. The Republican
right was really the most vulnerable, as the
enemy could reach it under cover, in the hollow of a
valley. And this they did; so that the defenders saw
them appear suddenly, and without warning, from that
concealment. Immediately the right wing fled, and
<a id='Page_179'></a>those occupying the houses retreated towards the
river.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was then at the battery; and, in disposing of my
troops, had reserved a company of the Italian Legion
at that point. I immediately made one-half of that
company charge the enemy; and after them sent the
second half to do the same. And that duty was executed
with so much courage, that the assailants were,
in their turn, put to a precipitate flight. The company
of Italians which performed that service was
under the command of Captain Carone, and its lieutenants
were Ramorino and Zaccarello.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy were discouraged by their unsuccessful
attempt, which prevented them from making any decisive
attack, and all their operations were reduced to a
cannonade. In that kind of fighting, although the
enemy had come upon the Republicans when ill-prepared,
from the want of time, yet we were able to
maintain a respectable attitude. I had landed the
cannon from the vessels, under the orders of their officers,
viz., Scozini, Cogliolo, and José Maria, all of
them brave and skilful men; so that the enemy's artillery,
although superior in numbers and position, was
pretty well opposed, and obliged to be occasionally
brought under cover of the hill. The enemy left
several men dead, while the Republicans had only a
few wounded. The latter, however, lost the greater
part of their oxen, which were in a corral, or inclosure;
and, as they were wild, as soon as the gate
<a id='Page_180'></a>was opened, they poured out, like a torrent, and
spread all over the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>For three days Urquiza continued his attempts; but
every day found the besieged better prepared. Not a
moment was lost during the night. Five pieces of
cannon were placed in the battery, the platform was
finished, the parapet, and the "Santa Barbara," or
mine for blowing up. A proclamation was circulated
at that time, signed by Colonel Baez and myself, condemning
to death any one who might leave his post;
and the smaller vessels were forbidden to come near
the bank of the river, while all which were there were
made to draw off.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time the enemy, seeing that they were
gaining nothing, adopted a system of blockade, and
shut up the city on the land side, in the closest manner.
But in that undertaking also they were frustrated;
for we were masters of the river, and could
bring in all necessary supplies of provisions by that
water. During the eighteen days which the siege
continued, we were not idle, having to bring in hay
for the cattle and horses continually; and, as the
enemy had formed a circular chain of posts around us,
we took advantage of moments of inattention, to attack,
and often with advantage. At length Urquiza became
weary, and perhaps was called away to other
parts of the Uruguay, by more pressing affairs. He
withdrew, and marched off, to cross the river above
Salto.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_181'></a>The two divisions of Lamas and Vergara now remained
to continue the siege, with about seven hundred
cavalry: but from that time the enemy were unable
to keep it closely, for the Republicans made
sorties now and then, sometimes bringing in oxen or
wild horses, and that kept our cavalry in a pretty
good condition, who had lost almost all their horses,
in consequence of the strictness of the siege. It is to
be observed, that the horses of that part of the country
are not accustomed to eat anything but grass, being
pastured in the open fields; and therefore but few are
fed with hay and grain.</p>

<p class='c007'>In those days an operation was performed by the
Republicans, of a superior kind. Garzon, who had
been at Concordia, opposite Salto, had marched, to
unite with Urquiza, for Corrientes, under the orders
of the latter General; but a cavalry corps of observation
remained at Concordia. The sentinels of that
body were visible from Salto, and their <i>cavalcade</i>, or
troop of horses, went every day to the river's bank to
feed, (probably finding better pasture,) and at night
returned. A plan was formed to capture those animals;
and one day about twenty men prepared,
naked, and with nothing but their sabres; while
a company of Legionaries, divided among the vessels
of the flotilla, waited, ready to embark in the
boats. About mid-day, when the sun shone hottest,
the enemy's sentinels were lying on the ground, having
made a shelter of their ponchos, and were fast asleep.
<a id='Page_182'></a>The river, at the place where it was to be crossed, was
only about five hundred paces wide, and not guarded.
The appointed signal was given, and the cavalry
soldiers marched from behind their coverts on the
shore, and threw themselves into the water, while the
Legionaries leaped into the boats; and, when the
sentinels awoke, they heard the bullets of their active
assailants whistling about their ears; and the amphibious
centaurs pursued them along the hill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only the brave South American cavalry are capable
of performing such an enterprise. Being excellent
swimmers, both men and horses, they can cross a river
several miles wide, the men holding by the tails of
their animals, or by their manes, and carrying their
arms and baggage in their <i>pelottas</i>, which are made of
the <i>curona</i>, a piece of leather, which forms a part of
the harness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the cavalry remained on the hill, watching
the enemy, while the others collected their horses
which were scattered about the pasture, and led them
to the shore, where they hurried them into the water,
and got most of them over to the other side. Some
of the enemy, who resisted, were bound and carried
across by the vessels. In the meantime the Legionaries
exchanged a few shots with the enemy, who were
increasing their numbers, but did not feel strong
enough to charge them. Thus, in a few hours, more
than a hundred horses were obtained by the Republicans,
without having a single man wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_183'></a>That affair was a very singular and curious one,
and performed in full view from Salto. The horses
of Entre Rios are generally esteemed; and, for good
reasons, that capture excited a desire to attack the
besiegers.</p>

<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>THE SIEGE OF SALTO CONTINUED—NIGHT ATTACK ON THE
ENEMY'S CAMP—SUCCESSFUL—GENERAL MEDINA
APPROACHING—SEND GEN. BAEZ AND ANZANI TO MEET HIM—A
GREAT SURPRISE—ALMOST OVERWHELMED BY THE ENEMY—FIGHT
TILL NIGHT—RETREAT.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>Vergara, with his division, was pressing the town very
closely, and some persons acquainted with the country
were sent to spy his position, which thus became
known to the defenders. It would have been useless
to make an attack by day, because it was impossible
to surprise them, and, therefore, it was necessary
to attack by night. I had given Colonel Baez the
command of the cavalry, and Anzani was with the
infantry. They left Salto after nightfall, and took the
direction towards the enemy's camp, situated about
eight miles off. Although the march of the troops was
as silent and as cautious as possible, they were heard
by the advanced sentinels, and therefore Vergara had
time to mount his horse. The assault was made without
loss of time, but only the cavalry of the Republicans
were able to fight, as the infantry, in spite of all
their exertions, could not reach the field of battle in
season. The enemy fought with spirit, but at the cry
of "The infantry!" which was raised at a favorable
<a id='Page_185'></a>moment, they gave ground, and then broke their ranks
and took to flight. They were pursued several miles,
but, on account of the darkness, little was effected.
A few prisoners were made and some horses taken,
while there were a small number of killed and wounded
on both sides. When daylight appeared, it was
difficult to find the field of battle, as the fighting had
been done on the march. Several groups of the
enemy appeared, scattered on the distant hills, and
Colonel Baez remained with the cavalry to pursue
them and to collect a herd of oxen, while the other
troops returned to Salto.</p>

<p class='c007'>About that time, which was the beginning of the
year 1846, we received news that General Medina,
with a number of emigrants from the Oriental, was
coming from Corrientes for Salto. The discomfiture
of Vergara had given the Republicans an advantage,
but had not produced the results that might have been
expected. Lamas, who was not far off, and engaged
in breaking horses, came up on receiving intelligence
of the defeat, and ordered the collecting of men. Both
established their camps, and recommenced the siege,
driving away the animals. Their superiority in
cavalry expedited that proceeding. General Medina
then came, who had been appointed head of the army,
and it was necessary to secure his entrance. Colonel
Baez, as has been mentioned already, had assumed the
command of the cavalry, and regularly organized it,
skilled as he was in that kind of troops. Being
<a id='Page_186'></a>possessed of uncommon activity, he greatly increased
the number of horses, and provided the city and the
troops with cattle. Mundell and Juan de la Cruz
were at his orders, and at that time both were
detached, with commissions to catch wild horses.
Colonel Baez, better known than General Medina,
was in direct relation with him, and knew that he was
to be in sight of Salto on the 8th of February; and
it was therefore arranged that I should accompany
him with the cavalry. At dawn of day on the 8th of
February, 1846, we left Salto, and took the direction
of the little river San Antonio, on the left bank of
which they were to await the approach of General
Medina and his army. The enemy, according to their
custom in that region, showed several troops of cavalry
on the heights on the right, which approached at times as
if to observe whether they were collecting animals, and
to interrupt them. Colonel Baez stationed a line of
marksmen of the cavalry against those troops, and
employed himself several hours in skirmishing with
them. The infantry had halted near the little stream,
at a place called Tapera di Don Vicenzio. I was
separated from the infantry, and observing the guerrillas,
fighting, conducted by Baez. That kind of warfare
afforded the Italians an amusing sight: but the
enemy concealed their "wasp's nest" under that kind
of military game, having put forward so feeble a force
only to deceive their opponents, and give their strong
body, which was behind, opportunity to advance.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_187'></a>The country, in all parts of the department of Salto,
is hilly, as is also that of San Antonio. Therefore the
large force which was advancing was able to approach
within a short distance without being discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>When I had reached the place of observation, and
cast my eyes on the other side of San Antonio, I was
overwhelmed with surprise by discovering, on the west
of a neighboring hill, where only a few of the enemy
had before been seen, a multitude of troops, as was
shown by a forest of lances: seven squadrons of
cavalry, with banners displayed, and a corps of infantry,
double in size of our own, who, having come up on
horseback, within two musket shots, dismounted,
formed in line of battle, and were marching, at quick
step, to charge with the bayonet. Baez said to me:
"Let us retire." But, seeing that to be impossible, I
replied: "There is not time enough; and we must
fight."</p>

<p class='c007'>I then ran to the Italian Legionaries; and, in order
to destroy, or at least to mitigate the impression
which might be produced on them by the appearance
of so formidable an enemy, said: "We will fight!
The cavalry we are resolved to conquer. To-day we
have them, although we are a small body of infantry."</p>

<p class='c007'>At the place where we took position there were numerous
wooden posts standing planted in the ground,
which had served in the walls of an old wooden
edifice; and to each beam was assigned a Legionary.
The remainder, forming three small parties, were
<a id='Page_188'></a>placed in column behind the building, and covered by
walls of masonry of the northern end of the same
building, which was in form of a room, capable of
containing about thirty men, and covering almost the
front of the little column. On the right of the infantry,
Baez was posted, with the cavalry, those being
dismounted, who were armed with carbines, while the
lancers remained on horseback. The whole force
comprised about a hundred cavalry, and a hundred
and eighty-six Legionaries. The enemy had nine
hundred cavalry, (some said twelve hundred,) and
three hundred infantry. The Republicans, therefore,
had only one thing left that could be done—to defend
themselves—resist, and repel the charge of the enemy's
infantry. I then ran forward, and gave them all the
attention in my power. If the enemy, instead of
charging in line of battle, forming an extended line,
had charged in column, or in alternate platoons, they
must have destroyed our force. By the impetus of
their column they would certainly have penetrated
into our position, and mingled with the defenders;
and then their cavalry would have completed our ruin
and exterminated us. Then the fields of San Antonio
would have been, to this day, whitened with Italian
bones! But, instead of this, the enemy advanced in
line, beating the charge, and bravely withholding their
fire until within a few yards. The Legionaries had
orders not to fire until very near. When the enemy
reached the appointed distance, they halted and gave
<a id='Page_189'></a>a general discharge. The moment was decisive.
Many of the defenders fell under that fire: but the
assailants were thrown into disorder, being thinned by
shots from the Republicans, who fired from behind the
timbers, and then charged them, not in order, but yet
in a body, and forced them to turn their backs, by
falling upon them with bayonets, like mad-men. That
there occurred for the Republicans a moment of disorder
and hesitation, it cannot be denied. There
were among us a number of prisoners, who, not expecting
a successful termination to the desperate
defence, cast about their eyes to find some way open
for escape. But they were prevented from doing anything,
by some of our brave men, who then, at the cry
of "The enemy run!" threw themselves upon them like
lions.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the moment when I directed my attention
upon the enemy's infantry, I saw nothing more of
Colonel Baez and the cavalry. Five or six horsemen
remained with my men, whom I put there under the
command of a brave Oriental officer, Jose Maria.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the defeat of the enemy's infantry, I had
hopes of safety; and, taking advantage of the momentary
calm produced by the stupefaction of the
enemy, I put my men again in order. Among the
dead remaining on the ground, especially those lying
where the enemy halted, we found abundant supplies
of cartridges; and the muskets of the killed and
wounded served an important purpose, being taken,
<a id='Page_190'></a>to arm those of the soldiers who were in want, and
some of the officers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy, having failed in their first charge, repeated
it several times, many of their dragoons dismounting;
and with them and masses of cavalry, they
attacked us, but succeeded only in increasing their
loss. I was always ready, with some of the bravest
of the Legionaries, who awaited the charge; and,
when the enemy had made their attack, invariably
charged them in return. The enemy several times
endeavored to get a position near us; but I then
posted the best marksmen among our soldiers, and
made them harrass them, until they took to flight.</p>

—BRAVERY OF MY ITALIANS—I NEVER DESPAIRED OF ITALY
—THE NOBLE CHARACTER OF ANZANI—REACH SALTO—KINDNESS

<p class='c006'>The fighting began about one o'clock in the afternoon,
and lasted until near nine in the evening. Night
came on, and found us surrounded by many corpses
and wounded men. About nine o'clock preparations
were made for a retreat. The number of wounded
was very large, including almost all the officers, viz.:
Morrochetti, Casana, Sacchi, Ramorino, Rodi, Beruti,
Zaccorello, Amero, and Fereti. Only Carone, Traverse,
and a few others, were unhurt. It was an
arduous and painful undertaking to remove them from
the ground where they lay. Some were placed upon
horses, which were numerous, while others, who were
able to stand, were helped on, each by two of his comrades.
When the arrangements had been made for
the accommodation of the wounded, the other soldiers
were formed in four platoons; and as fast as they were
put in order, they were made to load themselves with
some remaining ammunition, the less to expose themselves
to the continual fire of the enemy. The
<a id='Page_192'></a>retreat was then commenced, and I thought it a fine
sight,—though there was but a handful of men, in close
column, with orders not to fire a single shot before
making the edge of the wood which borders the river
Uruguay. I had directed the vanguard to take the
wounded, feeling confident that the charges of the
enemy would be made on our rear and flanks. As
was natural, those unfortunate men fell into some
disorder, which it was impossible to prevent; but they
yet went on, all, it is believed, except two. The little
column proceeded in the most admirable manner, so
that I must ever speak of their conduct with pride.
The soldiers fixed their bayonets before setting off;
and keeping close ranks, they reached the designed
place, though not for want of any exertions, on the
part of the enemy, to hinder them: for every effort was
made, by repeated charges from all quarters, and with
their whole force. In vain did their lancers come up
and give wounds to men in the ranks; the only return
made was with the bayonet, while the soldiers pressed
themselves more compactly together. On reaching
the verge of the wood, we halted; and the order was
given, "To the right about!" when immediately a
general volley filled the enemy's files with dead, and
they were all instantly driven back.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most severe sufferings endured that day
was from thirst, especially among the wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having reached the bank of the river, it may be
imagined with what avidity the soldiers ran to the
<a id='Page_193'></a>water. Some of them stopped to drink, while the
others kept the enemy at a distance. The success
of the first part of the retreat, now performed,
secured the retreating troops less molestation on the
remainder of their way. A chain of sharp-shooters
was formed to protect the left flank, who kept up a
continual fire, almost until they entered the city; and
thus we moved along the bank of the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anzani was waiting for us at the entrance of the
city, and could not satiate himself with embracing me
and my companions. He had never despaired, although
the enterprise was so arduous. He had
collected the few remaining men in the fortress, and
replied to the enemy's summons to surrender, which
they made during the battle, with a threat to blow up
everything before he would submit. It is to be
remarked, that the enemy not only assured him that
all the Italians were killed or prisoners, but also the
greater part of the soldiers with Baez. Still Anzani
did not despair; and I have mentioned him to those
of my fellow-citizens who at different times have
despaired of Italy. Ah! there are few like Anzani!
But he that despairs is a coward!</p>

<p class='c007'>Our retreating troops entered Salto at midnight,
and even at that hour we found all the soldiers and all
the inhabitants awake. The latter came out with
alacrity, and gave all possible attention and care to
the wounded, bringing everything necessary for their
relief and comfort. Poor people! Poor people, who
<a id='Page_194'></a>suffered so much in the various vicissitudes of war, I
shall never think of you but with a deep sense of gratitude!</p>

<p class='c007'>I had several severe losses to lament in that remarkable
affair, though the enemy were much the greater
sufferers.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Servando Gomez, who was the author of
the surprise, and who seemed as if he would annihilate
us forever, commenced his retreat on the 9th,
hastily taking with him his shattered division towards
Paisandu, with a great number of wounded men, and
leaving the fields of San Antonio covered with dead.
The first day after our arrival was occupied in giving
attention to the wounded; and two French physicians
rendered them the most important services. They
were the physicians of the French ship L'Eclair, whose
names have not been obtained, and Dr. Desroseaux,
another young man, then for some time connected with
the Italian Legion. He had fought all the way as a
common soldier, and then devoted himself to the care
of his wounded companions. But what most availed
at that painful time were the delicate cares of the
ladies of Salto.</p>

<p class='c007'>The succeeding days were occupied in collecting
and burying our dead. The battle had been so extraordinary,
that I thought it ought to be commemorated
by an unusual mode of interring the victims, and I
chose a spot, on the top of the hill which overlooks
Salto, and which had been the scene of successful
<a id='Page_195'></a>battles. There was dug a trench for all, and then
handfuls of earth were thrown in by the soldiers, until
a tumulus rose, to stand as a memorial. A cross was
then placed on the top, with this inscription on one
side:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>"<i>Legione Italiana, Marina e Cavalleria Orientale</i>."</div>

<p class='c006'>General Medina was now able freely to enter Salto
with his suite; and he retained the superior command
until the revolution made by Rivera's friends in Montevideo.
Nothing important, however, took place in
all that period.</p>

<p class='c007'>The revolution in Montevideo in favor of Rivera
gave a terrible blow to the affairs of the Republic.
The war ceased to be national, and was directed by
miserable factions. About the same time occurred the
revolution in Corrientes, brought about by Madariaga,
against General Paz. Those young chiefs, who had
become illustrious by surprising deeds in delivering their
country from the oppressive dominion of Rosas, now,
for jealousy and thirst of power, debased themselves
by the meanest treachery, and thus ruined the cause of
their people. General Paz was obliged to leave the
army of Corrientes, and retire to Brazil. Paraguay
<a id='Page_197'></a>recalled her army after his departure; the troops of
Madariaga, reduced by neglect to their own resources
alone, were completely beaten by Urquiza; and Corrientes
fell into the power of the Dictator.</p>

<p class='c007'>The affair of Montevideo also proceeded no better,
and few events of importance occurred. The Italian
Legion, so justly esteemed for their honorable and daring
exploits, had continued their accustomed service of advanced
posts, alternating with the other corps of the capital.
Anzani was with them; and, although no very
important engagements took place, they never failed to
prove themselves worthy of their fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>I occupied myself more with the marine, fitting up
some of the vessels which were most needed, and in
cruising on the river Plata, in the schooner "Maypú."</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime the French intervention proceeded
every day, and no more coërcive measure was it proposed
to apply to the solution of the problem; but
several diplomatists, whom Rosas deluded and mocked
at, were sent to negotiate, but obtained nothing
from him better than insignificant armistices, which
had no effect but to waste the limited means collected
with difficulty in the besieged city. With her change
of policy, France had changed her agents. Such men
as Diffandis and Ouseley for ambassadors, and L'Ainé
and Inglefield for admirals, worthy to sustain a generous
policy, and dear to the public, were removed; and
such men were substituted as were devoted to a policy
inevitably ruinous to the people.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_198'></a>The Oriental government, powerless from the want
of means, was obliged to submit to the dictates of the
intervention. Deplorable situation!</p>

<p class='c007'>Rivera, being restored to power by his partisans,
removed all others. Most of those who had engaged
in the noble defense from disinterested love of country,
had retired, weary of the enterprise, or were displaced
to make room for devotees of Rivera, and unfit men.
I found, however, at Montevideo, (that city of marvellous
changes,) the new elements of another army, and
transported them to Las Vacas, on the left bank of the
Uruguay. The soldiers of Montevideo were made for
conquerors; and they proved it in their first encounters
with the enemy in the country. At Mercedes, especially,
they performed prodigies of valor; but the
evil influence which misled Rivera at Arroyo Grande
and India Muerta, beset him at Paisandu, where, after
a victory, he saw his army defeated. At Maldonado
he embarked again, to return to Brazil, whether more
unfortunate or more culpable, it is difficult to determine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government of Montevideo having fallen into
the power of Rivera, I was left mourning over it, and
apprehending public sufferings. The old General Medina,
appointed General-in-chief by the government,
with the consent of the former not only yielded to
events, but, the better to recommend himself to the favor
of the new patron, intrigued against my friend; but
they deceived themselves. Both Italians and Orientals
<a id='Page_199'></a>loved him in Salto, and he would have been able, without
fear of any one, to rise independent of the new and illegal
power. But the cause of that unhappy people was too
sacred in his eyes. He loved them, and ever denominated
them as good-hearted and generous. To increase
their distresses, by fomenting their internal dissentions,
was wholly incompatible with his views and feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>To establish Rivera in power, the public squares of
Montevideo were made scenes of bloodshed. At Salto
the same fatal game was planned; but it proved impracticable.
I contented myself with making reprisals,
assuming, as at first, the command of the forces.
At that time occurred the successful battle against the
troops of Lamas and Vergara, on the 20th of May,
1846. Those two divisions, after the affair of San Antonio,
where they fought under the command of Servando
Gomez, had been reformed and reinforced; and
they again occupied their positions around Salto,
changing their encampments, but always keeping at
some leagues' distance. We did not fail, now and then,
to disturb our enemies as much as we could, especially
when they went out to catch animals. One Major Dominguez,
who had been sent for that purpose by General
Medina, was completely discomfited, losing all his
horses and some men. I had the positions of the enemy's
camp examined by spies, and in the night of May
19th, I marched to attack him. I had with me about
three hundred cavalry and a hundred legionaries—the
remains of a battalion. Poor youths! they have since
<a id='Page_200'></a>been sadly decimated! My object was to surprise the enemy's
camp at early dawn; and we arrived at the spot,
for once, exactly at the desired moment. I had the
aid of Captain Pablo, an American Indian, and a brave
soldier. His infantry were mounted, and they marched
all night, and before break of day came in sight of the
enemy's forces in the camp of General Vergara, on the
right bank of the Dayman. The infantry then dismounted,
and were ordered to attack. The victory
was very easily obtained. The troops of Vergara immediately
took to flight, and were driven into the river.
They left their arms, horses, and a few men, who were
taken prisoners. But the triumph was far from being
complete; for the troops were to return, and we set
off as the daylight increased. The camp of Lamas
was separated from that of Vergara by a small stream;
and, at the first alarm, the former had taken position
on the top of a hill, which commanded both camps.
Vergara, with the greater part of his men, had succeeded
in joining Lamas. They were warlike and
brave soldiers, made at the opening of the war.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having collected, in the abandoned camp, all the
serviceable horses, I pursued the enemy, but without
success. Most of my cavalry were mounted on <i>Rodomones</i>,
that is, horses caught and broken only a few
days before; and the enemy were better supplied. It
was therefore necessary to desist from pursuing them,
and be content with the advantages gained, and take
the road to Salto. We were, however, very unexpectedly
<a id='Page_201'></a>favored, and in an important manner. While
pursuing our march for Salto, we were in the following
order: a squadron of cavalry in platoons, at the head;
the infantry in column, in the centre; the remaining cavalry
for the rear guard, likewise in column. Two
strong lines of cavalry, commanded by Majors Carvallo
and N. Fausto, covered our right flank; and the
<i>cavallada</i>, with the horses of the infantry, marched on
the left. The enemy, having reörganized, as has been
said, and reconcentrated all their detachments, amounted
to about five hundred men in cavalry. Being acquainted
with my force, the enemy flanked us on the right, at
a short distance, so that he seemed disposed to revenge
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had placed Colonel Celesto Centurion in command
of the cavalry,—a very brave man; while Carone commanded
the infantry. The latter was particularly
urged by me to guard against any confusion or disorder
in his ranks, and to prevent it at any sacrifice. He
was to preserve their order, which was that of close
column, and never to make a movement by conversion,
but only by flanks and right-about-face. The infantry
was to serve as a point of support to Centurion, and
also to re-form in any event that might happen. The
enemy were emboldened, being increased by detachments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our troops proceeded over beautiful hills, for about
two miles from the banks of the Dayman. The grass
had but just begun to grow, but was very green; and
<a id='Page_202'></a>the surface of the ground was undulated like the
waves of the ocean, but lay in all the majesty of stillness,
while not a tree or a bush formed any obstacle.
It offered indeed a battle-field, and for the mightiest
hosts.</p>

<h3 class='c001'><span class='xlarge'><b>CHAPTER XXX.</b></span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>ON THE MARCH BACK TO SALTO—SUDDEN ATTACK
—DESPERATE DEFENCE—FLIGHT, AND PURSUIT—THE
"BOLLA"—EXCELLENCE OF THE HORSEMEN—INCIDENTS.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>Having reached the border of a brook, I thought it
better not to cross it, because our small force might be
disordered in the passage, and the hill on the right concealed
the great body of the enemy, who were not far
off, and marching in a direction parallel to our own.
I thought we would be attacked at that point; and the
result justified my expectation. I halted, and, wishing
to discover the enemy's condition, sent orders to Major
Carvello, to "charge that line of the enemy quite
to the hill." The charge was made, and with bravery,
as far as the eminence, where the assailants stopped,
and an adjutant came galloping up to me, to inform
me that the enemy were marching towards us at a
trot, and with their whole force in order of battle.
No time was to be lost. The cavalry on the wings
wheeled to the right, and were reinforced by the line,
suddenly concentrated. The infantry formed on the
right flank and towards the enemy. When the line
reached the top of the hill, the enemy's line was marching
upon us within pistol shot.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_204'></a>I must confess that the enemy had made a movement
of which my troops would not have been capable,
and which proved that they were brave, warlike,
and well commanded. Seeing this, without taking
time for reflection, I gave the signal for a charge: for
as soon as I discovered them, the enemy were converging,
from the centre to the wings, laterally; and, after
having made about half a circle beyond our flanks,
they charged our cavalry by platoons in flank, and so
rendered our infantry useless. I did not hesitate, but
ordered my cavalry to close in, and charge, to avoid
losing the advantage of the impetus of the horses.
And indeed they charged well, and fought bravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several charges were made by the cavalry on both
sides, and with different results. It would be difficult
to decide which party displayed most valor. The enemy
being superior in numbers, and in the excellence
of their horses, drove back ours upon our infantry,
and soon measured our lances with their bayonets.
The latter, having reformed, with the aid of their numbers,
drove them back, fighting them hand to hand.
The young Italians then performed their feats to admiration;
and I remember them, and the 20th of May,
with peculiar pleasure. Compact as a redoubt, exceedingly
active, they ran to every point where their
assistance was needed, always putting the assailants to
flight. The enemy fired very few muskets, but those
few were deliberate and sure.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last the enemy, having become disordered by
<a id='Page_205'></a>numerous charges, became only a deranged mass; while,
on the contrary, our troops, supported by the infantry,
were always able to reörganize for fighting well. The
engagement had lasted about half an hour, in that
manner, when, being no longer approached by organized
forces, we were drawn up anew and made a decisive
charge. The enemy then broke, disbanded, and
took to flight. A cloud of "<i>bollas</i>" whirled about in
the air, and presented a curious spectacle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>bolla</i> is one of the most terrible weapons used
by the South American horsemen. It consists of three
balls, covered with leather, and fastened to three
leathern cords, which are connected. One of the balls
is held in the hand, while the other two are flourished
in the air over the head, when the order is given to
charge. When a horse is struck in the leg with one
of them, it stops him, and sometimes makes him fall;
and in this way many captures are made. The South
American cavalry soldier is second to none in the
world, in any kind of combat; and in a defeat, they
retain their superiority in pursuing their enemy. They
are stopped in their course by no obstacles in the field.
If a tree does not allow them to pass while sitting
erect, they throw themselves back upon the crupper of
the half-wild horse, and disappear among the trappings
of the animal. They arrive at a river, and plunge in,
with their arms in their teeth; and sometimes wound
their enemy in the middle of the stream. Besides the
bolla, they carry the terrible <i>Coltelo</i>, or knife, which, as
<a id='Page_206'></a>before has been mentioned, they keep with them all
their lives, and manage with a dexterity peculiar to
themselves. Woe to the soldier whose horse tires!
"Bollado," or struck with the bolla, he cannot defend
himself from the knife of his pursuer, who dismounts to
strike him with it in the throat, and then mounts again,
to overtake others. Such customs prevail among them,
that sometimes, when men of courage meet, even after
a victory, scenes occur which would shock a reader if
they were described.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of those encounters I witnessed. It occurred
at a short distance from a line, between a party of our
soldiers and one of the enemy, whose horse had been
killed. Having fallen to the ground, he rose and
fought on foot, first with him who had dismounted him,
whom he treated very roughly. Another then came
to his assistance, then another; and at length he was
engaged with six, when I reached the spot, in order to
save the life of the brave man—but too late.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our enemy was now entirely routed, and the victory
complete. The pursuit was continued several miles.
The immediate result, however, was not what it might
have been, for the want of good horses, as many of the
enemy escaped. But, notwithstanding this, during the
whole time that the troops remained at Salto, we had
the satisfaction of seeing that department free from
the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action of the 20th of May has been described
at length, because of its remarkable success,—the fine,
<a id='Page_207'></a>open field on which it was fought, and the fine climate
and sky, which reminded me of Italy. The struggle
was with a practised enemy, superior in number, and
better provided with horses, which are the principal
element of that kind of warfare; and several single
combats took place on horseback, with great valor.
Our cavalry performed wonders that day, considering
their inferiority. Of the infantry, it will be sufficient
to mention the case of Major Carvallo, who was my
companion at San Antonio and Dayman, and in both
actions fought like a brave man, as he was. In each
of them, also, he had the misfortune to be wounded
in the face by a musket-shot. One struck two inches
below his right eye, and the other, in the same spot on
his left cheek, forming a strange symmetry in his face.
He was wounded the second time in the beginning of
the battle of Dayman; and after its close, he asked
leave to return to Salto, to have his wounds dressed.
Passing under the battery of the city, he was asked
what was the fate of the day, when he replied, although
he was able to speak but little: "The Italian Infantry
are more solid than your battery."</p>

<p class='c007'>The names of the dead and wounded in the engagement,
as has before been said, are given in Anzani's
"Journal of the Italian Legion."</p>

REVOLUTIONS IN EUROPE.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>After the battle of the 20th of May, at Dayman, nothing
important occurred in the campaign of Uruguay.
I received orders from the government to return to
Montevideo, with the vessels of the flotilla, and the
detachment of the Italian Legion. A few of the
smaller vessels remained at Salto, and the place was
left under the command of Commandant Artigos, a
brave officer, who distinguished himself in the battle
on the 20th of May. A few days after my departure,
Colonel Blanco arrived, and took command of the
place at the orders of General Rivera.</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of errors committed at Corrientes
and Montevideo, the cause of Rosas gained
strength very rapidly, and that of the people of the
Plata sunk into a desperate condition. The army of
Corrientes was destroyed by Urquiza in a battle; and
<a id='Page_209'></a>that unfortunate people, after swimming in blood, languished
under despotism. Rivera, not profiting by
the lessons of misfortune, ended as he had begun, by
removing from office men who had executed their duties
with faithfulness, and substituting his partisans, destroying
the materials of an army of operations, which the
courage and constancy of the people had created and
maintained with incorruptible heroism, and expatriating
himself under the contempt and malediction of all.
The English and French intervention was watched by
intriguers and faithless men. The positions in the interior
fell, one after another, into the power of the enemy.
Salto, which had been so honorably acquired and
maintained, was taken by assault by Sevando Gomez,
and Colonel Gomez perished in the defence—an old
and brave soldier—with a considerable number of men.
At length the defence of the generous Oriental people
was once more reduced to Montevideo; and there were
collected all the men who had become bound together
like brothers, by six years of danger, exploits and misfortunes.
There they had again to erect an edifice,
which had been destroyed by mismanagement, almost
to its foundations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Villagran, a veteran of forty years of war, a man
of virtue, of the greatest bravery, and reïnvigorated
by fighting; Diaz Bojes, shamefully banished by Rivera,
because he would not serve him, but his country;
and many other young officers, who have been dismissed
by him, returned to their posts, with the conscience
<a id='Page_210'></a>and the readiness of good men; and with them the
resolute and the faithful returned to the files of the
defenders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Orientals, French and Italians marched to the succor
of the country with alacrity; and not a word of
discouragement was heard from any one. The siege
of Montevideo, when better known in its details, will
be counted among the noble defences of a people fighting
for independence, for courage, constancy, and sacrifices
of all kinds. It will prove the power of a nation
resolved not to submit to the will of a tyrant;
and, whatever their fate may be, they merit the applause
and the commiseration of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the time of my return to Montevideo, to that
of my departure for Italy, in 1848, a period intervened
marked by no important event.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>CHIEFLY GIVEN IN OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, COLLECTED AND
TRANSLATED BY THEODORE DWIGHT.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>The translator of the preceding pages applied to
General Garibaldi, while in New York, to write an
account of the Roman Republic; and afterwards requested
several of the most intelligent Italian exiles
here to perform the task. They all declined, partly
for the want of leisure, being all engaged in daily
business for their own support. They, however, furnished
valuable communications, some of which were
embodied in "<i>The Roman Republic of 1849</i>." The
following pages are chiefly occupied by official documents,
which have been collected and translated for
this work, in order to present an authentic documentary
history of the great events in which General
Garibaldi performed conspicuous parts, through the
momentous struggle for liberty in Rome, in the year
1849.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><a id='Page_212'></a><b><span class='small'>GARIBALDI'S RETURN TO ITALY FROM SOUTH AMERICA, IN 1848.</span></b></h4>
<p class='c006'>The following brief outline of General Garibaldi's
movements, after the period terminating with the
close of his "Autobiography," and previous to the
first French attack on Rome, on the 30th of April,
1849, has been furnished for publication here by Dr.
G. Gajani, now a citizen of New York, and then a
member of the Roman Constituent Assembly, the
author of that highly interesting and instructive work,
"The Roman Exile."</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1848, when the news of the Italian revolution
reached Montevideo, General Garibaldi gathered his
Italian friends and sailed for Italy. They had arrived
in sight of Nice (the native city of Garibaldi), when
Colonel Anzani, the most intimate friend of Garibaldi,
breathed his last. Colonel Anzani was consumptive,
and the emotion excited by seeing Italy again proved
too powerful for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi with his friends proceeded to the field of
battle in Lombardy, and offered his services to King
Charles Albert, who received him coolly. A few days
after, the king was defeated, and signed an armistice
with the Austrians. Garibaldi was not included in
that armistice, and did not choose to lay down his
arms. Pursued by the Austrians, he fought several
skirmishes at Como, Varese, Laveno, and other places;
but his troops, being overwhelmed by numbers, disbanded,
and he retired into Switzerland—and, after
<a id='Page_213'></a>much suffering, finally made good his retreat across
the Po, into the Papal State, in October, 1848.
General Zucchi, the Minister of War of the Pope,
happened to be at Bologna, and wrote to Count Rossi,
Secretary of State of Pius IX., that Zucchi had ordered
two Swiss regiments (which were at the service of
the Pope) to march against Garibaldi, who was then
at Ravenna, and "throw him and his followers <i>into the
sea</i>"—meaning, probably, to compel them to embark.
But, before this order was executed, the Pope had fled
from Rome, and the popular government which undertook
to govern the State, enrolled Garibaldi and his
followers, and gave him a commission to increase his
band, and protect the eastern boundaries of the Roman
State against the King of Naples.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short time afterwards the elections for the
Roman Constituent Assembly took place, and Garibaldi
was elected at Macerata, and went to Rome to
take his seat in the Assembly, at its opening, on
February 9th, 1849.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that day Garibaldi put himself again at the
head of his troops, on the boundaries of Naples, and
returned with them to Rome, when the French had
landed at Civitavecchia.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b><span class='small'>PRINCIPLES OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLICANS, IN OPPOSITION<br />TO THE CLAIMS OF POPERY.</span></b></h4>
<p class='c006'>The Pope at this time published a long and tiresome
"<i>Encyclic</i>" filled with true Popish arrogance and
<a id='Page_214'></a>subtleties, to which pungent replies were made,—one
entitled, "<i>The Pope Excommunicated.</i>"</p>
<p class='c015'><i>Brief extracts from "Thoughts addressed to the Archbishops
and Bishops of Italy," "on the Encyclical
Letter of Pope Pius IX.," by Mazzini.</i></p>
<p class='c006'>The divorce between the world and him (Pius IX.),
between believing people, who are the true Church,
and the fornicating aristocracy who usurp its name, is
impressed on every syllable of the Pope's letter. For
many years the Pope has lost the power to love and
bless. Excited for a moment by the immense spectacle
of the resurrection of a people, Pius IX., two years ago,
murmured a benediction upon Italy; and that accent
of love sounded so new and unusual on the lips of a
Pope, that all Europe imagined a second era for the
Papacy, and became intoxicated with enthusiasm,
ignorant of the history of past ages respecting him
who had pronounced it. Now the monarchs have
been paid....</p>

<p class='c007'>The few important points which the Pope's letter
contains, are:</p>

<p class='c007'>1st, <i>A theory</i> on authority: and 2nd, <i>A doctrine</i> respecting
the evils of the poverty and ignorance which
afflict the people in Italy, and in a great degree elsewhere.
Both these deny God, the Word of Christ, and
human nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>... The Israel (of Italy) is the revolutionary
party, the national party, who say to Italians, <i>You are
not a race born to be slaves</i> of the Pope, or of the
<a id='Page_215'></a>Austrian whip; <i>you are twenty-six millions of people</i>,
created free, equal, brethren, all children of God, and
servants of nothing but his law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>theory</i> of the Pope's letter is this: "That the
poor exist in consequence of things which cannot and
ought not to be changed; that the Catholic religion
preaches to the rich to have charity, which will obtain
from God treasures of grace and eternal rewards;
that the poor should thank the Providence which keeps
them in misery, and that they know how to bear it in
peace and a light mind, as an easier way of salvation
in heaven."...</p>

<p class='c007'>And to this <i>theory</i> is superadded <i>the other</i>, respecting
authority: "Every authority comes from God;
every government, <i>de facto</i>, is a government of right.
Obey, or, resisting, be condemned."</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, or comprehending the two theories
in one: Earth and heaven constitute a perpetual
antagonism—-Right, equality and truth reign in heaven;
fact, force and inevitable evil reign upon earth. There
are two human races: the race of the rich and powerful,
and the race of the poor and servants. The poor
exist for the benefit of the rich, in order that the latter
may obtain heaven by exercising charity; and the
servants, in order that the masters can govern with
clemency and the spirit of love. When this is not
done, God will give punishments and rewards in
heaven; but, every attempt at melioration on earth,
by the efforts of the poor and servile race, <i>is sin</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_216'></a>And this is the religious doctrine which the church
of the Pope teaches to mankind in the nineteenth
century; and she teaches it in the name of the Gospel
of Christ, confronting it to the words—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='small'>"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven:"</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>the only prayer which Jesus taught to believers; confronting
it to the command, "Thou shalt worship the
Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve;" confronting
it to, "That all may be one, as thou, Father,
art in me and I in thee."</p>

<p class='c007'>No—it is not true that heaven and earth are in
antagonism; it is not true, that, while in heaven the
truth and justice of God reign, submission to fact and
reverence for brute force are a law of the earth. It is
not true that the salvation of human creatures is
secured, as if by expiation, by means of resignation or
indifference. The earth is the Lord's; the earth, on
which, and for which, Jesus, first, and after him all the
holy martyrs of mankind, shed their tears and their
blood.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b><span class='small'>THE CONDITION OF ROME.</span></b></h4>
<p class='c006'>The time approached when all eyes were to be opened
to the real designs of the French. A crisis was near,
when all the charitable hopes of the sincerity of their
amicable professions were to be dispelled. The city
was to be attacked by a foreign army for the first
time since the days of Charles V., in the period of the
Reformation, and for the second time since that of
<a id='Page_217'></a>the Northern invasions. In looking back for preceding
events of the same kind, the mind had but a single
step more to make—the attempt by the Gauls. How
different the state of the world since those times! How
different the condition of the city; the mode and
means of warfare; the principles engaged; the effect
to be anticipated on the world!</p>

<p class='c007'>Never before had the city of Rome been voluntarily
deserted by a pope, and brought to a state of order
and tranquility by a mere declaration of a republic,
and become practically and truly a Protestant city.
Never had she been, in the judgment of the world,
more certain to be overawed by a powerful host, and
more unable to resist. Deeply interesting must have
been the situation of many a family.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negotiations which had been carried on with
the Triumvirate, by M. Lesseps, the French agent, had
resulted in nothing but the manifest exposure of the
double-dealing of Louis Napoleon, and a display of
the integrity, ability and patriotism of the Romans.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a mixed multitude within the walls, but
most of them belonging to the city, or other parts of
the Roman States, and many of them soldiers who
had been engaged in one or more battles in other
parts of Italy. The whole number of Polanders and
other foreigners was trifling. Volunteers had been
hourly arriving for several weeks, some in regular
corps, or companies, others in small bands, and some
alone. Col. Manara had entered the city, at the head
<a id='Page_218'></a>of his legion of Lombards, raised and paid out of his
princely fortune, all which, with his services and his
life, he gave an offering to his country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following extract from the Roman <i>Monitore</i>,
the official journal, of June 28th, will give a specimen
of the style, and the dignity and intelligence with
which the people were daily addressed by the government.
After denying, in such terms, and by such
arguments as have been used in the preceding pages,
the calumnious charges against the character and
origin of the defenders of Rome, the <i>Monitore</i> enumerates
the troops in the city, as follows: "The army
of the Republic being ten regiments of infantry, and
two of cavalry—<i>all of them from the Roman States</i>;
the Medici Legion, of 300 Tuscans; the Foreign Legion,
of 250 men, French and Poles; the Italian
Legion of Garibaldi, about 2,000, <i>all except</i> 300 belonging
to <i>the Roman States</i>; and, finally, several battalions
of the Military Guard Mobile, some of Rome, some of
the provinces.... The pretended <i>foreign banditti</i>,
then, who <i>oppress</i> the Roman people, amount to 1,650
men, in a city of 150,000 inhabitants, and with 14,000
National Guards. These are the men, too, who for a
month have repelled 30,000 French troops, not only
from the city, but from the country-seats around it,
and defended a circuit of 40 miles! The most solemn
denial that can be given to the accumulated falsehoods
of our enemies, is to say to all the people of Europe,
"Look, and judge! Assaulted by four armies at once,
<a id='Page_219'></a>in the rushing ruin of Italian misfortunes, the Roman
Republic raised her sacred standard on the towers
of the Capitol, and guards the sacred fire of liberty."</p>

<p class='c007'>Day broke on Rome, on the morning of April 30th,
1849, upon a scene which no human foresight could
have anticipated, even a few weeks before, and which
human ingenuity could scarcely have imagined, even in
its principal features. The whole city was in solemn
expectation of the arrival of a large French force,
which was known to be on the march from Civita
Vecchia, and near enough to arrive at the walls in a
few hours. Arrangements had been made, and publicly
announced, to apprise the inhabitants of their
first appearance in sight, by the striking of bells.
Preparations for defence had been made, and were
still making, by the erecting of works in various
places in the squares and streets, to oppose the French
if they should enter the walls; while the troops
were prepared to fight them from the walls and the
ground outside. The elevated positions and buildings
were crowded by spectators, some of them foreigners,
of different classes, and from different countries. The
French had pretended to come as friends and protectors,
but persisted in advancing, even after being
assured by the Romans that they neither needed nor
desired their assistance. The French, then assuming
a tone of disdain, had plainly expressed their
belief that <i>the Romans would not fight</i>. The world
was waiting, with anxiety, the result of that day's
<a id='Page_220'></a>movements; and, probably, very few men believed
that the French would meet with any great obstacle.
They expected to dine that day in Rome, and to
remain masters of it as long as they pleased.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps no news has ever been more unexpected,
than that which was that day sent from Rome to all
parts of the world: that the Romans had fought the
French gallantly, with far inferior forces, for several
hours, and driven them twelve miles back towards
Civita Vecchia. Such, however, was the surprising
truth; and, had not the Triumvirate peremptorily
ordered Garibaldi to pursue them no further, he would
have continued to press them, with the resolution
which he had formed, of driving them into the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the spectators who wrote accounts of what
occurred that day, were several intelligent men of
different nations, who described the defence as conducted
with superior skill, and performed with the
greatest vigor and valor by the Roman officers and
soldiers. Interesting letters from some of these witnesses
may be found in the newspapers of different
countries, published soon after; and many concurrent
accounts in various other publications, particularly
"Italia del Popolo," a monthly magazine, published
by the exiled patriot leaders. We give below the
official reports of the principal events, during the
period of Roman liberty, in all of which Garibaldi
was a conspicuous actor.</p>

    <div><b><span class='sc'>Arrangements of the Battle of the 30th of April.</span></b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Triumvirate, with information furnished by the
Minister of War, Citizen General Avezzana, publishes
the following report:</p>

<p class='c007'>The time necessary to collect, from the different
military chiefs, the particulars relative to the engagement
of April 30th, has prevented us from publishing
earlier a precise relation. Now, since such particulars
have been minutely transmitted, we fulfil that duty
with such scrupulous exactness, as is demanded by the
truth of history and the just desires of the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the 29th, the commander in chief of the arms
of the Republic, General Avezzana, who is also the
Minister of War, was fully informed of the enemy's
approach by the numerous scouting parties, whose
reports were confirmed by a French prisoner, who, the
same day, fell into an ambush of our advance-posts.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the morning of the 30th, the telegraph giving
notice of the advance of the enemy's forces, announced
<a id='Page_222'></a>at nine o'clock, that they were within five miles of
Rome; and the Minister of War sent a captain of the
general staff to the cupola of St. Peter's, to remain
there until the firing should commence, to observe all
the movements of the enemy, and discover their numbers
and their intentions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime all measures were taken in the city
to repel the aggression, with such desperate energy as
is inspired by the holiness of right and the justice of the
cause. Strong and numerous barricades, at all the gates
and in all the principal streets, especially on the right
side of the Tiber, forbade all access into the city; the
bastions, rising above, crowned with cannon, were prepared
to fire upon the enemy; and the young army,
impatient with warlike ardor, placed at the different
points where the attack was expected, was disposed in
the following order: The first brigade, commanded by
General Garibaldi, and composed of the first Italian
Legion, the battalion of the University, the battalion
of the Reduced, the Legion of Exiles, and the Mobilized
Finanzieri, occupied, outside of the walls, the
whole line from the Portese Gate to the gate of San
Pancrazio; the second brigade, composed of two battalions
of the Mobilized Civic Troops and the First
Light, commanded by Col. Masi, occupied the wall of
the Gates Cavalleggieri, Vatican and Angelica; and
finally, the third brigade, commanded by Col. Savini,
and composed of the first and second regiments of
Mounted Dragoons, formed the reserve in Piazza Navona.
<a id='Page_223'></a>The fourth brigade, consisting of the first and
second regiments of the line, commanded by Colonel
Galletti, was in reserve at the Chiesa Nuova and
Piazza Cesarini, with all the field cannon not in position.
General Giuseppe Galletti, commander of Carabiniers,
and Major Manara, with the Lombard battalion,
forming separate corps, were held ready to proceed
wherever necessity might require.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everything concurred to indicate that the enemy,
who were eight thousand men, with two squadrons of
cavalry and twelve field-pieces, divided in two columns,
intended to make a double and simultaneous attack at
the gates Cavalleggieri and Angelica. In fact, about
eleven o'clock in the morning, proceeding by Villa
Pamfili, they occupied two houses, from which they
commenced an active fire of musketry and artillery
against the Cavalleggieri gate. The valiant General
Garibaldi moved from the gate of San Pancrazio, to
attack them in flank, with all his troops and the University
battalion; and there commenced a murderous
and obstinate battle, in which a hundred deeds of personal
bravery proved, that the modern Italians are
prepared to imitate the ancient glories of their fathers.
The French made a determined resistance to the onset
of Garibaldi; and even repulsed their assailants,
favored by their superior numbers and by their artillery,
which they fired briskly. But, being reinforced
by the Legion of Exiles, the Reduced battalion, the
Roman Legion, commanded by Col. Galletti, and two
<a id='Page_224'></a>companies of the first regiment of the line, charging
simultaneously, with the bayonet, they compelled the
enemy to retire precipitately, leaving in the hands of
our troops about three hundred prisoners, among whom
were six officers, with the commander of a battalion,
and a great number of killed.</p>

<p class='c007'>While they were fighting thus at San Pancrazio,
other attacks were made on the gardens of the Vatican,
and along the entire line, from the Cavalleggieri
gate to that of Santa Marta, where the enemy endeavored,
with all their power, to silence our artillery,
and where they made two furious assaults, but
were bravely repulsed by the Masi Brigade and the
Mobilized Civic, assisted in good time by the brave
and ardent Carabiniers. At all those points our
troops sustained the attacks of the enemy with admirable
firmness and coolness, and, by fighting with the
bravery of veteran soldiers, compelled them to make
a precipitate retreat. In that encounter the National
Artillery deserve special commemoration, under the
command of Colonel Calandrelli, who lost two distinguished
officers, besides wounded; and also the
Civic Artillery, who rivalled the former in zeal and
ardor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus repulsed on the whole line, the French retired
first to Bravella, three miles from the city, whence,
after a short stop, they continued their retreat towards
Castel di Guido, from which, doubtless, they will go
to Civitavecchia.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_225'></a>This battle, which wonderfully consolidated the foundation
of our Republic, lasted about seven hours, beginning
at ten in the morning and ending at three in the
afternoon, without including, as a part of the contest,
the little skirmishes which were continued until evening,
between our ardent soldiers and the bands of the
enemy who were pursued without ceasing. According
to facts collected, and the statements made by the
prisoners, it appears that the enemy lost more than
fifteen hundred men, including killed, wounded and
prisoners. On our part we have to lament only fifty
killed and two hundred wounded, among whom are
many officers, subaltern and superior.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have only a sentiment of admiration and a word
of praise, equal for all, officers, soldiers and people,
who took part in the combat of the 30th. All fought
like heroes; all showed that when the love of country
is living and ardent, the sacrifice of life is sweet. In
such a case we cannot make a better eulogium on the
valor of our brave men, than by repeating an extract
of a letter written by General Garibaldi to the Minister
of War:</p>

<p class='c007'>"All the corps which have fought this day are extremely
well-deserving of the country. A detachment
of the line, the first Roman Legion, the University
battalion, the Arcioni Legion, the battalion of the
Reduced, and the first Italian Legion have been rivals
in valor. The chief officers and the soldiers of those
corps have merited the gratitude of Italy and the title
<a id='Page_226'></a>of valiant men. Many arms, drums and other articles
of war have remained in our power."</p>

<p class='c007'>The merits of the sanitary officers of our ambulances
ought not to be forgotten, who were diligent in collecting
on the field, the wounded, on whom were lavished, as is
done in the hospitals, by the ladies, services truly fraternal;
and in mourning over losses, it is grateful to
say, that among the French themselves, many declared,
before dying, that they left life with remorse for having
fought against brother-republicans; while those who
were saved, imprecating their government, know not
how to thank us for the assiduous cares of which they
have been the objects, but by repeating as often as
their countrymen are made prisoners, '<i>Viva la Republica
Romana!</i>'</p>

<p class='c007'>In short, a profound sentiment of gratitude requires
us to give to that most truly Italian General, Avezzana,
a word of encomium, though far inferior to that great
love of country which impels him to provide for every
exigency of the onerous ministry entrusted to him,
with a tenacious perseverance, and an indefatigable
alacrity, which would have been prodigious in a young
man. From the first approach of the enemy, followed
by a portion of his staff, (for many other officers belonging
to it were appointed to the gates, to direct the
corps which defended them,) General Avezzana visited
in succession the places attacked, and by his voice and
his example, raising to the highest degree the enthusiasm
of the people, until they asked for arms, and with
<a id='Page_227'></a>the soldiers who were fighting bravely, secured the
triumph of the day and the honor of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this aggression, France, sacrificed by a government,
the enemy of the true interests of their country, has
suffered immense losses, more moral than material; she
has lost all political influence; she has no right to our
sympathies; and if the justice of our cause has given
so much energy to conquer the most warlike soldier,
we have now the profound conviction of being able
to contest, with glory and success, against all the
enemies of the Republic and of Italy.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><b>FROM AN ACCOUNT OF THE SAME BATTLE OF APRIL 30TH,<br />BY CARLO RUSCONI.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>General Oudinot, who, with 8,000 men and 12 field
pieces, wished to raze Rome to the ground, ordered a
simultaneous attack on Porta Cavalleggieri and Porta
Angelica, and occupied two houses of Villa Pamfili,
from which he opened an active fire of musketry and
artillery. He presented himself against General Garibaldi,
one of those men who serve as types in the creations
of art. Beautiful in person, simple in habits, frugal
in living, courageous as the heroes celebrated in
chivalry, he exerted a fascination on all who surrounded
him. He had a thousand men about him, who would
<a id='Page_228'></a>have allowed themselves to be killed a thousand times
at his slightest command. Concise in manner, sparing
of words, terrible in wrath, you would have said that
Byron must have had this extraordinary man before
his eyes, when he delineated his immortal Conrad;—Garibaldi,
who was not in his element except when
balls were whistling round his head, moved against
the French, attacked them in flank, and, supported by
Col. Galleti, discomfited them, after many hours
fighting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi, having seen that the engagement with
musketry proceeded too slowly, and impatient at that
mode of fighting, made a charge on the French with
the bayonet, in the most destructive manner, and which
secured him the victory. Finding that that method
turned out well, he never abandoned it in the successive
conflicts; and this explains the great number of
killed in that obstinate war.</p>
<hr class='c017' />
<h4 class='c018'><b>SPIRITED PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLE OF ROME, BY THEIR<br />REPRESENTATIVES, THE DAY AFTER THE FIRST BATTLE.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>People! yesterday commenced the entrance of the
French into Rome. They entered by the Porta San
Pancrazio—as prisoners! To us, people of Rome, this
does not cause much surprise; but it may excite a
curious sensation in Paris. That also will be well.</p>

<p class='c007'>People! the attack will be renewed. Let us do as
we did yesterday; and especially do not be alarmed
<a id='Page_229'></a>if a few batteries should be silenced by their cannonade.
Reports of cannon startle the ears, and
somewhat shake the houses: but, in fact, when they
do not reach united masses of people, they destroy but
very few victims....</p>

<p class='c007'>We request good shopkeepers to keep at their business
constantly: that will have a good influence and
be very convenient at the same time.</p>

<p class='c007'>To-day we have need to fortify Pincio, (the Pincian
Mount;) be there early, in goodly numbers, and let us
labor together.</p>

<hr class='c003' />
<h4 class='c014'><b>PROCLAMATION BY THE COMMITTEE OF THE BARRICADES,<br />TWO DAYS AFTER THE FIRST BATTLE.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>People! General Oudinot promised to pay all and
all in cash. Well, let him pay, if he can, for the
Tapestries of Raffaele, shot through with French bullets;
let him pay for the losses—no, not the losses,
but the insult cast on Michael Angelo. Napoleon at
least carried to Paris our master-pieces, and in a certain
way Italian genius received the admiration of the
foreigner, as a recompense for the conquest. Not so
to-day. The French government invade our territory,
and carry their singular predilection for Rome
so far, as to wish to destroy her, rather than have her
exposed to the impatience of the terrible (General)
Zucchi, and the threats of Radetzky and Gioberti,
who are both at several weeks' distance from the
<a id='Page_230'></a>Tiber. General Oudinot is more hasty than our enemies.
The Republic is grateful to him. Do you
know why? Because, while the Imperialists occupy
Alessandria, without a blow struck by Charles Albert,
it is a great Italian glory, that the People's Rome
honorably repels the Republicans of France, whom a
black government sends against us, after calumniating
us as robbers and assassins. And the Popes? Let us
preserve, in memory of them, the cannon-balls which
solemnly celebrated the anniversary of the Pontifical
Encyclic. Enough! Of kingdoms and triple kings
let us talk no more. Let us now think of the Barricades.
Let us think of our honor, which we must
fully vindicate. Rome, like Scævola, has still her arm
on the burning torch, and has sworn an oath. The
three hundred of Scævola routed Porsenna. The
history of Rome is not yet finished.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><b>THE NEAPOLITAN INVASION.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>On the same day the following Proclamation was
published by the Triumvirate, announcing the approach
of the numerous army of the King of Naples.
Five days later they announced the arrival of the
Spanish army, of 5000 men, on the coast. Both those
armies had been raised, in obedience to the call of the
<a id='Page_231'></a>Pope, as well as that of France, which had just been
so manfully driven from the walls of Rome.</p>

<hr class='c003' />
<h4 class='c014'><b>PROCLAMATIONS OF THE TRIUMVIRATE,<br />AT THE TIME OF THE NEAPOLITAN INVASION.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'><i>Rome</i>, May 2d, 1849.—Romans! A corps of the
Neapolitan army, having covered the frontier, threatens
to move against Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their intent is to restore the Pope, as absolute master
in temporal affairs. Their arms are persecution,
ferocity, and pillage. Among their files lurks their
king, to whom Europe has decreed the name of <i>the
Bombarder of his own subjects</i>; and around him stand
the most inexorable of the conspirators of Gaeta.</p>

<p class='c007'>Romans! We have conquered the first assailants:
we will conquer the second. The blood of the best
Neapolitans, the blood of our brothers of Sicily, lies on
the head of the traitor-king. God, who blinds the
wicked, and strengthens the defenders of right, chooses
you, O Romans, for avengers. Let the will of the
country and of God be done.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the name of the rights which belong to every
country; in the name of the duties which belong to
Rome, in regard to Italy and Europe; in the name of
the Roman mothers, who will bless the defenders of
their children; in the name of our liberty, our honor,
and our conscience; in the name of God and the
<a id='Page_232'></a>people; let us resist, soldiers and people, capital and
province. Let Rome be as inviolable as eternal justice.
We have learned that, to conquer, it is enough
not to fear death.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='small'>THE TRIUMVIRS.</span></div>

<hr class='c003' />
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE BATTLE OF PALESTRINA.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>The retreat of the French army back to the seashore,
and the armistice which occurred after the first
battle, of April 30th, afforded a remarkably convenient
opportunity to attend to the King of Naples
and his army, which amounted to about twenty thousand
men. The following is a description of their
position, and the marching of the Roman army against
them, translated from the beginning of the report of
Gen. Roselli, then commander-in-chief. The report
includes the time from his leaving Rome, May 16th,
until the occupation of Velletri, May 20th, 1849.</p>

<p class='c007'>"The Neapolitan army occupied the position of
Albano, Velletri and Palestrina, and had their line of
operations directed towards Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>The army of the Republic left Rome, to attack the
enemy, on the 16th and 17th, and manœuvred to turn
their flanks and cut off their communications with
the Neapolitan State. The point of direction of the
army was Monte Fortino, whence it might menace all
the enemy's communications.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Neapolitans had no other way but to retreat,
or come out and attack us in the positions we had
<a id='Page_233'></a>chosen. The army was composed of five brigades,
and one of cavalry, with twelve pieces of cannon.
The first brigade, with a squadron of lancers and two
pieces of artillery, commenced the march. I left
Rome at five o'clock, <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and took the direction of
Zagarola, by the road of Campanelle, to expose the
right flank as little as possible. The march was very
rapid; we reached Zagarola at ten before noon. The
vanguard passed the town rapidly, and encamped on
the hills which defend the roads of Palestrina and
Albano. According to instructions, the next day it
was intended to attack Palestrina, and then march on
Velletri; but we learned, from our patrols and information,
that the enemy were no longer in Palestrina,
having concentrated their forces in Velletri. It was
then immediately decided to occupy Monte Fortino.</p>

<p class='c007'>The order had been given to put the army in movement
before daylight; but, from misunderstanding,
and insufficiency of the means of transport, the arrival
of provisions having been delayed, our brave soldiers
were compelled to lose precious time," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The report of the commander-in-chief being deficient
in details, I sought for more particulars from Gen.
Garibaldi, and soon obtained the following succinct
account, written down from his lips, accompanied with
a hasty plan of the battle-ground, drawn by his pen.
It now became evident that the common opinion was
correct, which attributed the two remarkable victories
of Palestrina and Velletri to Garibaldi; as the vanguard,
<a id='Page_234'></a>led by him, had all the fighting to do; and the
main body of the Roman army, under Roselli, did not
arrive until the result was mainly secured.</p>

<hr class='c003' />
<h4 class='c014'><b>GEN. GARIBALDI'S ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLES<br />OF PALESTRINA AND VELLETRI.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>"My first object," said he, "was to turn the enemy's
flank; for I thought that if the King of Naples once
heard that I was in his rear, he would be frightened;
and so it proved."</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is the substance of his account of the
engagements, from notes taken in 1850:</p>

<p class='c007'>The Neapolitans occupied the strong positions of
Tusculum mountains, with their head-quarters at Velletri,
and their advanced guard at Albano. Their
extreme left was at Castel Gondolfo, and their extreme
right a small village.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle of Palestrina was about ten days before
that of Velletri. The troops present at the former
were a hundred cavalry, under Col. Massina; 300
Bersaglieri, under Col. Manara; 200 Finanzieri of
the Nationals; 200 Students, mobilized; and the
Italian Legion, of 1,000—in all, about 1,800 men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi was sent out to harrass and observe the
Neapolitans, with his division, and was at Palestrina,
when seven thousand of the enemy were sent against
him, with the intention of attacking him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the Tusculum Mount and Palestrina is a
valley, in one of the projections of the Apennines, in
<a id='Page_235'></a>an amphitheatre. When Garibaldi perceived that
the enemy had arrived at Valmontone, he sent a detachment
to observe them. But it was repulsed, with
the videttes, and retired upon the corps. When the
Neapolitans reached Palestrina, Garibaldi prepared
to defend himself. The enemy advanced, by two
roads, against Palestrina, when Garibaldi prepared
two companies, to protect the returning soldiers, or to
harrass the enemy, if occasion should offer; while he
remained in the centre, with a reserve.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Neapolitans extended in line, and attacked;
but were repulsed on the left and the centre. The
two companies on the right were driven back, when
Garibaldi, being victorious in other parts, proceeded
with the reserve to the right, and the rout of the
enemy was then completed. A strong body of royal
Swiss troops, in the pay of Bomba, was present. The
Republicans being destitute of cavalry, and the speedy
arrival of night, saved the wrecks of the troops of
Bomba.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Palestrina, Garibaldi returned to Rome.</p>

<hr class='c003' />
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE BATTLE OF VELLETRI.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>A few days after, he again left Rome, with the
Roman army, and was in the vanguard, having under
his orders the First Italian Legion, of eleven hundred
men; the Third of the line, eight hundred; fifty
cavalry, and two light guns.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_236'></a>At Valmontone he received advices that the Neapolitans
were sending back their baggage and heavy
artillery, and he therefore concluded that they were
retreating, and pressed forward, sending notice to the
principal corps. At Monte Fortino he received more
positive information, and continued to advance with
haste. About eight o'clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> he was in sight of
Velletri, which was on the road, and two miles distant.
He then discovered the enemy's cavalry, in
<i>échellon</i>, on the Appian Way, to protect the retreat of
their army, for which they were preparing. The
main body of the Neapolitan army was then at Velletri;
and, as soon as Garibaldi's corps was discovered
by them, the Neapolitans moved to attack it.</p>

<p class='c007'>He drew up the Third of the line, in <i>échellon</i>, by
companies, near the road, which was among hills
covered with vineyards, to protect his retreat in case
of necessity, and to act as a reserve in case the enemy
should attack. He placed the First Italian Legion
on both sides of the road, in the best position he could,
and thus awaited the assault of the enemy, leaving
two companies in column in the road itself. The
cavalry and artillery he placed in positions adapted
to be most serviceable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy attacked: but all their attempts were
fruitless. They had many killed, and were finally
obliged to shut themselves up in the city, on the defensive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi's corps alone was too weak to prevent
<a id='Page_237'></a>the retreat of the enemy, which was finally effected
by night.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal corps of the Roman army, of seven
thousand men, under Roselli, arrived late, and tired
with their march. An attempt, however, was made to
attack the city in front, by charging, at the head of
the First Roman Legion, with the battalion of artillery
placed in a good position upon the road. The Neapolitans
sustained the positions of the city, in which
they remained the rest of the day. The Republicans
took positions, in order to renew the attack the
next day: but in the morning the Neapolitans retreated,
and disappeared from Velletri.</p>

<p class='c007'>These bold and successful operations, so briefly
described, were of the highest importance, in their results,
both by driving back the enemy, by encouraging
the Republicans, and by adding to their reputation.
The rout of the Neapolitans was so decisive, that
they gave no further annoyance, and never appeared
again during the war.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for the poor Spanish army, which had landed on
the coast, in obedience to the call of the poor Pope,
they did nothing but issue a few bombastic proclamations,
and kept themselves out of harm's way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French, in the meantime, were preparing to
take decisive measures against Rome. The wounded,
whom they had left behind them on the 30th of April,
had been tenderly nursed by the Roman ladies, who
had volunteered to attend at the hospitals; and three
<a id='Page_238'></a>or four hundred prisoners had been harangued in the
Corso, by the commander-in-chief, addressed as brother-republicans,
in the name of the government and people,
and dismissed without exchange or parole, with
open gates, to return to Civitavecchia. On their
arrival there, however, full of their praises of the noble
Romans, they were immediately shipped for France,
for fear of their influence among the troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French army soon moved, in great force, for
Rome, with heavy artillery and all preparations for a
siege. But their first step was to violate the amnesty,
by suddenly attacking the outposts, the night before the
time limited by the armistice, and while they were
almost unprotected.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><b>GENERAL GARIBALDI'S ACCOUNT OF THE<br />ACTION OF JUNE 3d, 1849,</b><br /> <br /><b><span class='small'>WITH THE FRENCH, AT VILLAS CORSINI AND VASCELLO.</span></b></h4>
<p class='c006'>On leaving the Bastion, the ground on the right
rises a little in the direction of the Villa Vascello;
and on the left forms, by a gentle descent, a little
valley, which leads towards the French camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the gate of San Pancrazio a street leads
directly to the Vascello, (two hundred and fifty paces,)
and then divides. The principal branch descends on
the right along the garden of the Villa Corsini, surrounded
by high walls, and goes on to join the great
<a id='Page_239'></a>road to Civitavecchia. Another, flanked by hedges,
leads directly to the Villa Corsini, which is three hundred
paces in front of the Villa Vascello. And the
third road turns to the left, and is prolonged, like the
first, by the wall of the garden of the Villa Corsini.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Villa Vascello is a large and massive fabric
of three stories, surrounded by gardens and walls. In
front of the Villa (fifty paces) is a small house, from
which firing may be made against the windows of the
Villa Corsini.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the left road, (one hundred paces,) beyond the
point of separation of the streets, are two small houses,
one behind the garden of Villa Corsini, the other
twenty paces before, on the left of the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Villa Corsini, placed on the highest part of the
ground, commands all the neighborhood. It is surrounded
by a garden and high wall. The position of
the Villa is very strong, and the more so because
wishing to attack it without showing any preparation
of approach before hand, it is necessary, while passing
the concello, which is at the foot of the garden, to
bear the concentrated fire which the enemy, defended
and covered by the hedges and vases, or within the
Villa itself, make upon that point at which the
garden-walls meet at an acute angle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ground is also very descending; and, besides,
the Villa Corsini is very favorable to the enemy,
because declining, and being scattered with groves,
and crossed by deep streets, they can concentrate their
<a id='Page_240'></a>reserves in security from our fire, when the cannon
oblige them to abandon the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first attack made by the Italian Legion was
against the positions Corsini and Quattro Venti, which
had been abandoned by our troops, because surprised,
betrayed, and overpowered by the great number of the
enemy. The attack was made with the bayonet, without
firing a single shot; the Legion sustained, for
about three-quarters of an hour, the whole weight of
the enemy; and Colonels Daverio and Massina, and
Commandant Peralta were killed, and most of the
officers wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment arrived the Manara Bersaglieri,
who throwing themselves into the garden, vigorously
attacked the enemy, even under the walls of the Villa.
Here fell Captain Dandolo and many soldiers; and
many officers and soldiers were wounded. But from
that moment the houses on the left were ours. The
enemy had stopped their progressive work, and the
Vascello, strongly occupied, poured on them a fire of
grape shot. The brave artillerymen very soon disturbed
the enemy in the Villa Corsini.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Manara Bersaglieri, from the Casini on the left,
and the Italian Legion from the Vascello, drove the
French Tiraglieurs from the garden and hedges. Both
parties kept up a very warm fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy were no more able, although reinforced
and protected by two pieces of artillery, to take from
our troops the position held with so much valor.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_241'></a>The artillery fired upon the Villa Corsini so vigorously,
that the enemy were compelled to retreat,
after setting it on fire; while the cannon in the
right Bastion, and Bersaglieri, thrown forward of the
Vascello, attacked with great ardor the enemy, who
were in the Casino Quattro Venti, and who occupied
numerous small adjacent houses, from which they made
a very heavy but useless fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the left, towards the French camp, two companies
of the Manara Bersaglieri were then sent, who
went far in advance, to annoy the enemy, hidden among
the vines.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very severe conflict continued all day, always to
the advantage of our troops, who were able, even a
second time, (the Manara Bersaglieri and Italian
Legion,) to charge the enemy beyond the Villa
Corsini.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards evening several companies of the third
regiment of the line were sent to reinforce our troops
in the Vascello; and the Medici Legion was sent to
relieve the Manara Bersaglieri in the Casini on the left.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cannon reduced almost to dust the Villa Corsini
and the Casino Quattro Venti, being wonderfully well
directed—due praise to the brave Lieut. Col. Ludovico
Calandrelli.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy were beaten at all points. Our troops,
and especially the Manara Bersaglieri and the Italian
Legion, again and again charged the enemy breast to
breast.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_242'></a>The first company of Manara Bersaglieri threw
itself into the Villa Giraud, and made many French
prisoners. The Italian Legion several times advanced
up to Villa Valentini.</p>

<p class='c007'>At evening the Medici Legion vigorously charged
the enemy among the vineyards on the left.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night came, leaving to us the field of battle, the
enemy admiring our valor, and our troops desirous
of renewing the battle, which had been so courageously
fought on the first day. This they did on the following
morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the officers, and especially the superior and
subaltern officers whom I wish to distinguish, are these

<h4 class='c018'><b>OFFICIAL BULLETIN OF EVENTS WHICH<br />TOOK PLACE ON THE 25TH AND 26TH OF<br />JUNE, 1849.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>In the last night the enemy made an attack, to dislodge
our troops from the Casino, outside the gate
San Pancrazio, called the Vascello, but were repulsed
with great loss. For the particulars of that action,
glorious to our arms, I publish the following extract
from a report sent to me by the brave general of
division, Garibaldi:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><b><span class='small'>GEN. GARIBALDI'S REPORT TO ROSELLI,</span></b></div>
    <div><b><span class='small'>THE GENERAL-IN-CHIEF.</span></b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Citizen General-in-chief</span>:</p>

<p class='c007'>One hour after midnight the enemy tried a second
attack, and assaulted our right flank, breaking in
towards the Vascello, which is under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Medici, and on the left side of the
Casetta, which is under the command of Major Cenni.</p>

<p class='c007'>With lively pleasure I communicate to you how
heroically our troops sustained themselves, and powerfully
repulsed them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very deep mist, which involved everything,
rendered the conflict the more interesting. Our
soldiers gave proofs of their diligence and love for
the cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many dead, who still lie unburied on the enemy's
ground, bear them witness. And the highest encomium
<a id='Page_244'></a>is due in general to the detachments Medici and
Melara, and to the Manara Bersaglieri, on the right
wing, and on the left to Major Cenni, of the staff of
the division; and, of the Arcioni legion, to Captains
Joanny, Baily, Romagnori; 1st Lieutenant Carlotti;
2d Lieutenant Bellonghi; and to all the soldiers of
that corps. Of the Regiment of the Union, Capt.
Colombani and Lieut. Dezzi distinguished themselves.
The soldiers are the same as those who so lately defended
the Casetta, near the Vascello.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the detachment of the line should not be forgotten,
commanded by Sub-Lieutenant Ferrandi, of
the 3d regiment, who showed themselves openly, and
intrepid under fire. When the firing had ceased, in
consequence of the repulse of the enemy, there was an
almost perfect silence, interrupted only by a few exchanges
of shot, chiefly harmless. Nothing important
occurred before daybreak, and things still remain as
yesterday.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following editorial passage follows the preceding
report, in the same paper, the <i>Monitore Romano</i>.
As it relates to a subject of which much use was afterwards
made by the French and Popish writers, to
justify themselves, and falsely to accuse the Romans,
<a id='Page_245'></a>it seems proper to insert it here, for the information
of the reader. In spite of what is here said (greatly
to the disgrace of the French invaders), many of the
statues, buildings, pictures, and other valuable "monuments
of the city," were injured, and some destroyed,
by their bullets, grape-shot, cannon-balls and bomb-shells.
They chose their point of attack near St.
Peter's church and the Vatican palace, and sometimes
appeared to aim their artillery for the wanton destruction
or injury of those and other edifices.</p>

    <div><b><span class='small'>From the Monitore Roman of June 26th, 1849.</span></b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Paris <i>Constitutionnel</i>, and all the other journals
of the (French) government, make known the reason
why General Oudinot has not yet entered Rome, in
the following passage:</p>

<p class='c007'>"It is wrong to believe that Rome can be, in a few
days, rescued from the state of defence in which it has
been placed by the <i>foreigners who occupy it</i>. Even if
the possibility of success in an attack by main force
were demonstrated, with the use of all the means authorized
by war, other considerations should prescribe
the greatest circumspection to our general-in-chief.
In reality, the order to attack, which was sent to Gen.
Oudinot, contains an express recommendation to adopt
the most complete measures to avoid the exposure of
the monuments of the city, which are now placed under
the safeguard of France. Considerations of humanity
are no less in the plans of our generals, who in no
<a id='Page_246'></a>case will confound the Roman population with the
bands of adventurers who ruin and oppress it. For
all these reasons, the besieging forces will confine
themselves to the attack of exterior works, and of
positions from which the city and the monuments can
not receive any injury."</p>

<p class='c006'>[Remarks on the preceding extract from the <i>Constitutionnel</i>,
by the editors of the <i>Monitore Romano</i>.]</p>

<p class='c007'>"This, it cannot be denied, is an ingenious expedient
to justify the slowness of the <i>brilliant successes</i>
of Oudinot under the walls of Rome. It is not a
posthumous expedient, but a witty one, invented <i>after
the act</i>. The General had first to think how to let his
bomb-shells by hundreds fall, not upon the <i>foreigners</i>
who defend Rome, but upon the heads of the harmless
population whom he has come to <i>protect</i>. He must
think first how to ruin the edifices of Raffaelle, the
Aurora of Guido, the temple of Fortuna Virilis, and,
only yesterday, the most beautiful fresco of Poussin,
in the palace Costaguli, now irreparably lost, because
it has never been copied or engraved.</p>

<p class='c007'>"But this does not prevent the Roman monuments
from being placed <i>under the safeguard</i> of the French
arms! This did not prevent them from having within
their scope the defence of the liberty of the people,
oppressed by foreigners! Hypocrites and wretches!
you do not possess even the brutal frankness of Austria!"</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_247'></a>The following brief notices of events in Paris, published
in the same number of the <i>Monitore Romano</i>,
convey striking hints of the condition to which Louis
Napoleon was reducing France, while his army was
attempting to overthrow the Roman Republic, and
fabricating excuses for his ill success.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Paris</i>, June 15th.—The members of the Legislative
Assembly under trial for revolutionary proceedings
exceeds twenty; and the list is not yet complete,
(Ledru Rolin was at the head of these.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moniteur publishes two decrees of the President
of the Republic. By the first, considering that
the existing condition of Paris renders necessary the
union in one hand of all the disposable forces of the
national guard and of the army, it is decreed, that
General Changarnier shall unite the superior command
of the national guard of the Seine with the
command of the troops of the first military division,
until the public tranquillity shall be restored in the
capital. By the second, the city of Lyons and all the

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>General Head-quarters, San Pietro in Montorio,
July 1, 1849.</i>—Yesterday was a day fruitful in deeds
of arms: losses and advantages. Yesterday Italy
counted new martyrs. Colonel Manara leaves a void in
the Republican files, difficult to be supplied. Young,
of surprising merit and valor, he was struck by an enemy's
ball, while courageously defending the Villa Spada
against an enemy very superior. America yesterday
gave, with the blood of a valiant son, Andrea Aghiar,
a pledge of the love of liberal men of all countries for
our fair and unfortunate Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Colonel Medici distinguished himself by
skill and courage, in the defence of the first bastion
on the right of the gate of San Pancrazio, and of the
position Savorelli. He was distinguished in the company
of the brave Colonel Ghilardi, commandant of
that line.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Medici Legion and the first of the line fought
like lions. They several times repelled assaults in the
breach, and paid with the precious life of many young
men, the hope of the country, the sacred debt of all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part of the Manara Legion fought at the point of
<a id='Page_250'></a>the bayonet with their accustomed courage, in union
with the companies of the regiment Massi.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Italian Legion, under the command of Colonel
Manara, showed itself worthy of its fame in the defence
of the Villa Spada. The Third of the Line, in
defending the positions which were confided to it,
covered itself with glory.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Garibaldi</span>.</div>

<hr class='c003' />
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE CITY TO CEASE HER RESISTANCE.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>It was now decided that the further defence of
Rome was impossible, without exposing the city to
destruction. The enemy were within the walls, and
could not be dislodged. They were indeed so strong,
that the Romans would be obliged at least to abandon
their line, and retire to this side of the Tiber, which
General Avezzana and Garibaldi proposed to defend
with obstinacy. But the inhabitants apprehended,
from such a step, the speedy ruin of their houses by
the French cannon and shells; and, after a Council
which they held with the Assembly, it was resolved to
cease resistance. Garibaldi saw that his work was
done in the capital; and, with feelings which we may
in some degree realize, he resolved not to witness the
disgrace brought upon his noble cause, nor to leave
his gallant companions to be disarmed and remain
useless to the country. He doubtless foresaw that
many of them would follow wherever he would lead;
and then certainly, not less than at other times, he felt
<a id='Page_251'></a>an impulse to lead where only courageous men would
follow. He thought of the city of Venice, then besieged
by the Austrians, by sea and land, and indulged
the flattering hope of being able to reach her,
and join her brave defenders. The wide space to be
passed over, and the far superior force which the enemy
could send to oppose him, were insufficient to discourage
him; and he resolved to go. But one
obstacle was in his way. His wife was urgent to
accompany him, which he opposed; but in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government issued the following proclamations:—</p>

<p class='c006'>The Constituent Roman Assembly, in their session
of yesterday, definitively voted, with unanimity, and
<i>viva voce</i>, the Constitution of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having fulfilled, by this act, the essential part of its
high mission, the Assembly decreed, on motion of the
Deputy Agostini, that the law be engraved on two
marble tables and placed on the capital, as an eternal
monument of the unanimous will of the people, legitimately

who shall touch those tables of the new civil and
political compact which the Roman People form with
themselves before God, in the view of all civilized nations!
This compact has been sealed with the blood
of martyrs, with the blood of all those who, following
the voice of their hearts, hastened to Rome, as to the
ancient Mother, to defend the honor and the liberty
of Italy, and to lay the first stone of her future and

<p class='c007'>Before dissolving the solemn session, the Assembly
decreed a funeral in the Basilica of St. Peter, to all
the heroes who have offered their lives for the country
and for the Republic, under the walls of Rome. As
to the wounded, as no less worthy of honor, and in
need of care, the Assembly voted a Hospital, and appropriated
for the purpose one of the national palaces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, that nothing might be wanting to the harmony
which always prevails among the people, the
Constituent Assembly and the citizens in whom, in the

<p class='c007'>We have said it, and we repeat it, and we will repeat
it always: The Republic arose in Rome by universal
suffrage; rose on the ruins of the throne of the Popes,
which the cry of all Europe, the maledictions of all
civilized nations, and the spirit of the Gospel, had
crumbled into dust. To-day, when on that throne,
stigmatized by civilization, flows the blood of so many
victims, who will dare to raise it again? A mountain
of corpses shuts up, to the Pontiff, the way to that
throne; and to ascend it again, the white stole of the
<a id='Page_255'></a>priest must be dyed with human blood! Can the
Pope, like the tyrants, sit upon a seat of bayonets?
But it is not in the power of France, it is not in the
power of Europe conspiring, to restore the Pope to
the minds of citizens, after the enormous events which
have occurred. The sceptre of the Popes is morally
broken for ever.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><b>GARIBALDI'S DEPARTURE FROM ROME</b><br /> <br /><b><span class='small'>WITH HIS REMAINING TROOPS, AND HIS<br />CELEBRATED RETREAT TO THE ADRIATIC.</span></b></h4>
<p class='c006'>Garibaldi collected his troops after the government
had determined to cease resistance, and addressed them in
his Spartan speech, which has been so much admired;
then proceeding out of the gates, followed by
<a id='Page_256'></a>a considerable portion of his troops, he took his course
across the Campagna, his wife accompanying him on
horseback, notwithstanding all his affectionate remonstrances.
He had resolved to make a desperate effort,
to avoid the necessity of submitting to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The retreat of Garibaldi from Rome to the little
port of Cesenatico, on the Adriatic, while pursued by
an Austrian and a French army, has been much admired
for the boldness, skill and judgment which were
displayed, through a daily change of dangers, discouragements
and sufferings, which would seem too great
to be so long endured. His route lay through Forli
and Cantalupo to Terni, then declined to the left to
Todi, Capretto and Orvieto, where the French troops
showed themselves; then on to the frontier of Tuscany,
after which they passed Arezzo, and crossing a mountain,
reached Cisterna; then, passing on to Borgo,
Santangelo in Vado, and Montefeltro, he arrived at
San Marino, near the close of July, and left there on
the night of the 31st for Cesenatico, where they embarked
in several boats, and sailed for Venice. Several
of these were captured or sunk, and others driven to
the shore, among which last was that which contained
Garibaldi, his wife, Bassi, Cicerouacchio, and his two
sons, whose fate has been mentioned in the preceding
pages.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='small'>The portion of Garibaldi's life recorded in the preceding
pages, interesting and important as it was, now proves to
have been but the prelude and preparation of the mighty
and momentous scenes which Providence had in reserve for
an extraordinary man like him, fitted by such a long, arduous,
and perilous training as he had received, under the supervision
of heaven. A war like that of Armageddon, so
awfully depicted in the Book of Revelation, was now preparing;
and all the effects of the persevering labors and pious
prayers of Italian patriots, devoted to the liberation of their
<a id='Page_258'></a>country, were now to be seen in the spirit of harmony and
bravery which had been inculcated by the secret societies,
fostered by the experience gained in the revolutions of 1820,
'31, and '46, and many insurrections attempted; and now for
the first time, under a leader long known for his unequalled,
noble, pure, and exalted character, as well as for his incomparable
skill and boldness, and his astonishing success in the
field. And what unexpected changes in the situations of
Europe, and especially of Italy, were brought about by
events whose tendency was not discovered by human eyes,
until war commenced between Sardinia and France on the
one side, and Austria on the other.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>Only a short time before, peace might have been expected
to continue, and the oppression of Italians to be prolonged
by Austria, the Pope, and the King of Naples. There were
no uncommon signs of approaching disturbance; and Garibaldi,
in his favorite island retreat, was quietly cultivating his farm,
and seemed likely to reap in peace the little field which he was
sowing.</span></p>
<h4 class='c014'>THE ISLAND OF CAPRERA.</h4>

<p class='c019'>This little rocky island, near the northeastern coast of Sardinia,
has now a peculiar interest, on account of its connection
with Garibaldi. Its greatest length is five miles, and
its greatest breadth three. Its name intimates the nature of
its soil and surface, it being rough, rocky, and barren, and
well fitted for goats.</p>

<p class='c007'>It belonged to the government, and a portion of it was
purchased by Garibaldi, it is believed, about the year 1856,
when he made it his residence, took a number of his fellow-exiles
thither, and founded a small colony, directing his attention
to the cultivation of the ground. He afterward sent to
New York for some American implements, and prosecuted
his design with diligence, until a vessel, which he had loaded
with necessaries, especially a quantity of lime, was lost on
the voyage, and left him without requisite means to proceed
<a id='Page_259'></a>with his buildings and other improvements. He still, however,
regarded that little secluded island as his home, and
has returned to it at every interval of peace and leisure.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was Garibaldi, waiting for the day to arrive, which
he had so many years anticipated, hoped and prepared for,
and which he had endeavored to make as visible to the eyes
of his countrymen as it seemed to be to his own. Yes, the
day was near at hand which he had written down in his
preceding autobiography, pages 112, 115, etc. On page
125 he said: "Be great, once more, O Italy, and then the
powerful voice of the Almighty will be heard by all thy sons;
and the hungry, cowardly vultures which destroy thee, will
be stunned by its thundering sound."</p>

<p class='c007'>Such, also, was the expectation which he expressed in
1850, in his note of courteous but decided refusal of the
honors of a public reception in the city of New York, and
which we here translate from his refined Italian original,
addressed to the committee:</p>

<h4 class='c014'><b><span class='small'>GARIBALDI'S REPLY TO THE NEW YORK COMMITTEE,<br />AUGUST 3d, 1850.</span></b></h4>
<p class='c012'>"<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>: I much regret that my very poor health does not
allow me to take part in the demonstration which you have appointed for
next Saturday. The length of my convalescence, and the uncertainty
of the time of my recovery, still render it impossible for me to fix
a day when I may be able to yield to the wishes of your affectionate
and flattering invitation. I hope you will allow me to repeat,
more warmly than at first, the desire which I have often expressed to
you, that you will entirely abandon the proposed demonstration.</p>

<p class='c022'>"Such a public exhibition is not necessary to secure for me the
sympathy of my countrymen, of the American people, and of all true
republicans, for the misfortunes which I have suffered, and for the
cause which has occasioned them.</p>

<p class='c022'>"Although a public manifestation of that affection would be most
grateful to me, exiled from my native land, separated from my children,
and weeping over the fall of the liberty of my country by foreign
intervention; yet believe me, I would rather avoid it, content
that it is allowed me, tranquilly and humbly, to become a citizen of
<a id='Page_260'></a>this great Republic of free men, to sail under its flag, to engage in
commerce in order to earn my livelihood, and to wait for a moment
more favorable for the redemption of my country from oppressors,
both domestic and foreign.</p>

<p class='c022'>"In regard to the cause to which I have consecrated myself, I
esteem nothing more than the approbation of this great people; and I
believe it will be sufficient for them to know, how I have honestly and
faithfully served the cause of liberty, in which they themselves have
given a great and noble example to the world.</p>

<div class='c023'>"<span class='sc'>G. Garibaldi.</span>"</div>

<p class='c007'>The committee published their reply to this letter, and
closed it with these words:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"We lament the modesty of Gen. Garibaldi, which, more than
his imperfect convalescence, has prevented the success of our urgent
requests."</span></p>

<p class='c006'>A small volume has been published by Alexander Dumas,
a French novel-writer, of which different opinions have been
expressed. It was asserted, last summer, by the "Philadelphia
Press," that it was pirated from the first edition of this
book, in the French language, and had been translated into
English and sold to an American bookseller for five hundred
dollars. There are many passages in it which might appear
to countenance such an assertion; but there are numerous
passages, and even entire chapters, which are wholly unlike
anything in the latter; and a large part of the volume contains
views, sentiments and expressions quite the opposite of
Garibaldi's. Indeed, of the 337 small duodecimo pages in the
English translation, only 203 are claimed by M. Dumas
to be Garibaldi's, other writers being credited for the
remaining 134. The 203 pages contain passages which magnify
Garibaldi's deeds or spirit much more than he was ever
known to do, (for he is always as modest as brave,) with some
of his most forcible expressions and passages greatly weakened
by useless amplifications. The English translation is
in a very loose and inferior style; and various cases occur
<a id='Page_261'></a>in both Dumas and his translators, in which ignorant
blunders are made in interpreting the standard before them,
whatever it may have been. The motto of chapter 6th Dumas
gives in his French, "Le Dieu des Bons Gens:" and his
English translator: "<i>The God of Good People</i>." And this
is afterward repeated, showing a surprising and laughable
mistake in the import of the motto of the Italian Republicans,
"<i>Dio e Popolo</i>"—God and the People.</p>

<p class='c007'>The personal appearance of Garibaldi, his mien, address,
and manners, are so remarkably accordant with his character,
that clear impressions of them seem necessary to a distinct
apprehension of the spirit with which he lays his plans, and
commences and accomplishes his great deeds. A stranger
may obtain such impressions, in a considerable degree, by
contemplating the fine steel engraving which forms the
frontispiece of this volume, and reading some of the descriptions
written by different observers on various occasions.
That portrait is accurately copied from a daguerrotype, for
which he obligingly sat, at the request of the author, soon
after his arrival in New York in 1850; and has been pronounced
by many of his friends the best likeness they have
ever seen. It certainly is exactly like the daguerrotype, not
only in the features, but in the expression of the face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any one who would form a correct opinion of the state of
preparation in which the people of Italy stood waiting for
the time of their emancipation, must recur to the labors of
the patriotic leaders who had been constantly laboring to
enlighten and inspirit them during the last forty years.
Their efforts had been principally through secret societies,
formed and conducted somewhat on the plan of freemasonry.
The Carbonari (literally, colliers—the makers of charcoal in
the mountains, where the patriots often found refuge) were
dissolved, after their archives had been seized. The society
of Giovane Italia (Young Italy) was then formed, and
directed by Mazzini and his friends, from foreign countries,
safe from the reach of the enemy. One striking case of their
<a id='Page_262'></a>sagacious and successful operations is described in that most
interesting and instructive work on Italy, "The Roman
Exile," by G. Gajani, formerly an eminent Roman jurist, an
officer under Garibaldi in 1849, and now a respected citizen
of New York. Thousands of other instances might be mentioned,
to prove the powerful influence of those efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The union of Italians</i> was the great object aimed at, and
<i>non-interference by foreign powers</i> was the principle claimed of
Europe. The Republicans of 1849 declared that monarchy
was opposed to both these ends; but, since Sardinia, England
and France have all proved by their actions that they
have adopted these principles, the Republicans have joined
their old opponents, the constitutional monarchists, and
ranged themselves under the banner of Victor Emanuel.
Garibaldi was a Republican in South America, Rome,
and everywhere, until he became convinced of this change of
policy; and now he is devoted to Victor Emanuel—because
Victor Emanuel is devoted to Italy. When the voice of
calumny shall have ceased, justice will be done to men who
are now iniquitously stigmatized.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what men those were, who then, like lions suddenly
roused, sprang from their lairs and rushed to the fight in May,
1859. Those alone who knew them, can form an adequate
conception of their feelings, because each had passed through
trials which none of us have known, or witnessed among our
own happier countrymen. Many of them had been exiles in
America, and a number had been residents in New York,
and personally known, respected and loved.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large collection of manuscripts now at hand, in various
forms, of various kinds, and of different dates, recall the
characters and histories of their authors; and what may hereafter
be published from them will be strictly true, except
some changes of names, which propriety may require. Among
the papers are letters, notices of friends in need, warnings
against plotting enemies—Jesuits in disguise, and long
histories of romantic adventures.</p>

SUCCESSES AT VARESE AND COMO.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>Louis Napoleon, in 1848, when a candidate for the presidency
of the French Republic, solicited the assistance of the
clergy, saying that, if elected, he would reinstate the Pope
in Rome. Afterward, in April, 1849, Louis Napoleon sent an
expedition against Rome, under the command of General
Oudinot. That general, on his arrival before Civita Vecchia,
published a proclamation, printed in France, by which it was
announced that France would occupy Rome, in order to
prevent Austria from doing so.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems that Louis Napoleon was not so much guided by
his promise, or by religious devotion, as by the shrewd
design of securing to himself the influence of the Pope,
which Austria would have turned against him. The Pope,
however, continued to lean toward Austria; and, by her
advice, opposed all the suggestions of Louis Napoleon, and
placed him in a false position.</p>

<p class='c007'>From 1849 to '59 was a period of secret intrigue and
struggles at Rome, between France and Austria. The
Crimean war added a new element of hostility between the
two courts. Napoleon, as a threat to Austria, invited the
<a id='Page_264'></a>king of Sardinia to participate in that war, and afterward
allowed Count Cavour to speak in the name of oppressed
Italy, in spite of the protest of the Austrian minister.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this, Austria became more active in preparing and
countenancing the ruin of Napoleon in France; and the
Pope used his influence with the clergy and the legitimists
of that country. Napoleon was thus laid under the necessity
of striking a blow at Austria, in self-defence. This
explains his league with the king of Sardinia. But Napoleon
neither designed nor foresaw all that happened afterward.
The complete liberation of Italy and the downfall
of the papacy were not in his plan; because he feared that a
general convulsion of Europe would be the consequence of
such events. In justice to him, however, we must acknowledge,
that he has countenanced and aided those events,
since he has seen that they were accomplished in a wonderfully
quiet manner. There can be but little doubt that
Napoleon prefers to see the political influence of the Pope
dead forever, instead of being compelled to court it, in
competition with Austria.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in 1859, the Emperor of Austria began to threaten
Sardinia with 100,000 men, demanding that she should disarm,
which was refused. The Emperor of the French showed
himself ready to sustain Victor Emanuel in his position;
and then the Emperor of Austria made an effort to gain
time by an artifice, and pressed a powerful army on to the
frontiers. With surprising promptitude, Louis Napoleon
sent a very large force into Piedmont, partly across Mount
Cenis and partly by water to Genoa, availing himself of the
facilities offered by the railroads and steam vessels, and
armed with the most improved military weapons and implements
of modern warfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then commenced one of the most important and sanguinary
conflicts of modern times, and one most decisive of
results in favor of Italian liberty. The armies on both sides
were very large and powerful, and included many of the
<a id='Page_265'></a>chiefs, officers, and soldiers who had been trained in Africa
and the Crimea, as well as in the European wars ten and
twelve years preceding. The sudden and rapid advance of
the Austrians was checked by the vigorous stand made by
the Piedmontese, and the still more rapid movements of the
troops from France. We have not room to give all the details
of the battles which ensued, and with which the public are
acquainted. The service which our hero rendered in it was
of the utmost importance; and not only fully justified the
high reputation he had long enjoyed, but raised him to an
eminence proportioned to the magnitude of the immense
military operations in which he acted a leading, and we
might say almost the decisive part.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Garibaldi was called by the king to engage in the
war, he accepted the office proposed, but, it has been reported,
on two conditions: that he should be allowed to act
according to his own judgment, and as far from the French
as possible. We do not pretend to give credence to this
rumor, and can only say, on the one hand, that he showed
some symptoms, while in this country, of retaining a bitter
recollection of the siege and humiliation of Rome; but, on
the other hand, that he is charitable, generous, and forgiving
beyond most other men who ever lived on earth. No sooner
was it known that Garibaldi was forming a band to act
against the Austrians, than patriots hastened from all parts
of Italy to join his banner. Such were their numbers and
their enthusiasm, that the authorities in vain attempted to
detain them; and even from the Pope's territories, and from
the cruelly oppressed kingdom of Naples, volunteers poured
like torrents on toward Piedmont. Promptly a corps was
formed under Garibaldi's peculiar tactics, denominated, "<i>I
Cacciatori delle Alpi</i>" (The Huntsmen of the Alps), and, led
by their spirited and fearless leader, started toward the
north, and disappeared among the mountain passes of the
Alps. No sooner was this news received in the United
States, than his friends here foretold that his aim would
<a id='Page_266'></a>prove to be, to turn the right wing of the Austrians, get
into their rear, and raise Lombardy in insurrection. With
anxious solicitude the first inquiries of all seemed to be first
for Garibaldi; and the deeds of daring, labor, fatigue, and
skill which he performed were repeated through that great
and bloody campaign with skill and perseverance equalled
only in his uniform success.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who have seen enough of Garibaldi to form a just
estimate of his character and powers, can never be at a loss
in drawing a picture of him in their imaginations, when they
hear that he has been placed in a new scene fitted to call
forth his energy. So it was when the news was received
that he marched from Turin with 3,700 men, his chosen
band, to Biella and Borgomanero, toward the northeast,
and had moved with such promptitude and rapidity, and by
such secluded and difficult paths, that no certain information
could be obtained of his route, plans, or objects. Those who
knew him at once declared that his former practices compelled
them confidently to predict that he had gone among
the mountains to turn the right wing of the Austrians, and
raise the country in insurrection in their rear. Many days
passed, however, before the truth was known, though various
reports came through different channels. At length it
was published as certain that he had been successful in a
laborious march, and in the accomplishment of a sudden
and bold attack upon the Austrians at Varese. By ingenious
arrangements he had deceived the enemy, whose spies,
as he had expected, carried them true reports of his past
movements, present position, and possible preparations, but
drew false conclusions of his intentions.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><b>THE BATTLE OF VARESE.</b></h4>

<p class='c019'>The Canton Ticino is a narrow part of Switzerland, lying
along a small river of that name, and extending down far
into the north of Italy. The interesting history of that
<a id='Page_267'></a>small and rude territory deserves to be much better known,
especially on account of the devotion of its virtuous inhabitants
to the principles of the Reformation, and the persecutions
which they have at different periods endured for their
faith. The river Ticino is difficult of passage, and, as the
Austrians were strong in their position at Varese, beyond it,
it was important to prevent them from meeting him at that
stream. At Borgomanero he prepared his plans, and put
them in harmony with the instructions given him at head-quarters.
The principal object was to cross the Ticino and
effect the passage and invasion without danger to himself or
his men. Garibaldi knew that all these men risked their
lives, inasmuch as before becoming soldiers they were refugees,
and by bearing arms they incurred, according to the
Austrian code, the penalty of death. He accordingly spread
the report that he intended to stop at Arona, and he even
himself wrote orders to have stores and lodgings prepared
there, and the churches fitted up for the reception of horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner had he sent off these orders by special messengers
to Arona, which is on the Lago Maggiore, than he
gave orders to his men, each of whom carried two muskets,
to leave for Castelletto, where they crossed the Ticino in a
ferry-boat to Sesto Calende, and by an astonishing forced
march of two days, proceeded to Varese.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Austrians, on learning how they had been tricked,
assembled at Camerlata, and intercepted the line of the
Ticino at Varese, believing that they would thereby cut off
the retreat of the force and surprise it. Garibaldi troubled
himself little about that proceeding, and induced the towns
and villages to revolt.</p>

<p class='c007'>A proclamation was issued by the general, inviting the
whole of the Varesotto province to rise against their oppressors.
The appeal was generally listened to, and men of every
age and condition hastened to the official residence of Marquis
Visconti, the extraordinary commissioner sent by Count
Cavour as the coadjutor of the Italian general. In less than
<a id='Page_268'></a>two hours the whole of the surrounding country was in arms.
Old men, children, and even women, came to the Town Hall,
with all sorts of weapons, ready to help the small band
(3,000) of their brethren. Varese was soon fortified, barricades
erected, means of defence carefully ordered. Bands of
peasants were pouring into the town from the numberless
hamlets, villas, and villages which deck the picturesque hills
of that beautiful country—the finest in Lombardy, and, perhaps
of Europe. Garibaldi, who is always to be found everywhere
when danger is coming, began to array in companies the
new comers, and gave the necessary orders for the defence of
the country, as he supposed that the Austrians posted at
Gallarate would attack him the next day.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not deceived in his expectation, for on Wednesday
morning, at dawn three hundred Croats and one hundred and
thirty Hussars, with a field battery, marched from Gallarate
to Sesto Calende, where the advance guard of Italian Chasseurs
was posted. This advance guard was commanded by
Capt. Decristoforis, a young man of great military ability, who
only two months before was in England, and kept a first-rate
military school at Putney. After a fight, which lasted
two hours, the enemy was completely defeated, leaving some
prisoners. The Austrians were obliged to retire on Somma,
and nothing was heard of them till next morning at four
o'clock.</p>

<p class='c007'>This second attack was of a more serious character. It
was effected by a brigade, five thousand strong, with ten field
pieces, and two squadrons of Uhlans. After a first discharge
of their muskets, the Italian volunteers assaulted the enemy
with the bayonet, and with so much impetuosity that the
Austrian centre was obliged to fall back on its left wing,
then engaged by a battalion of the Italian right. Now the
fight became general—a tremendous hand-to-hand fight, in
which every inch of ground was bravely disputed by both
armies. The enemy's artillery was of no more use, because
Garibaldi, having none, had ordered his men to fight
<a id='Page_269'></a>hand-to-hand with swords and bayonets. At the report of the
musketry and artillery, the country people hastened to the
scene of action with pitchforks, half-pikes, and cleavers. "It
was a dreadful scene of slaughter," said an eye-witness, "which
lasted three hours." Nothing can give an idea of the impetuosity
of those Italians who could at last revenge so
many wrongs, so many cruelties. It was almost madness.
Two brothers Strambio, one captain and the other lieutenant,
were seen to leap into the inside of a hedge of bayonets, and
cut down Croats as if they had been puppets. A Count
Montanari, from Verona, whose brother had been hanged, in
1853, by Radetsky's order, was running up and down the
bloody field, striking right and left with his powerful sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 7 o'clock, the Austrian general was obliged to give the
order for a retreat, as his men were falling in all directions.
Garibaldi was close at their heels till they reached the strong
position of Malnate, where they stopped to repair their losses.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a short but faithful sketch of Garibaldi's exploit.
It will always be recorded as one of the most brilliant
actions of the war, because he had no artillery, and his soldiers
were but volunteers, scarcely drilled, and unaccustomed
to camp life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi then went to Como, on the celebrated lake of
that name, where he received a positive ovation from the
population. All the country was in full insurrection. Young
men were putting themselves in uniform, and arming themselves.
All classes, without distinction—nobles, peasants,
citizens, men, women, and children—were prepared for resistance.
Garibaldi had taken the precaution of being able
to supply the population with arms and ammunition.</p>

<p class='c006'>Como is a city beautifully situated on the northern end of
Lake Como; but on the low land near the margin, and overlooked
by the mountains, which rise beyond and around.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enthusiasm which prevailed on Garibaldi's arrival was
extreme; and the alarm bells were rung in all the communes of
the Varesotto, Tramezzo, Como and Lecco districts. The
volunteers were pouring in from every village and hamlet.
In this manner the insurrection gained ground in Upper
Lombardy. At the first appearance of the braves, all the
civil authorities of Como and Lecco recognized the government
of King Victor Emanuel, which in those towns was
represented by Count Visconti Venosta, a young nobleman
from Valtellina of great determination. His spirited proclamations
roused the enthusiasm of country folks and citizens,
who hastened to the scene of action with an ardor never witnessed
in 1848. Money, so much wanted, poured into Garibaldi's
military treasury, together with gold necklaces and
other valuable trinkets from fair Lombard ladies. The sum
thus collected in two days reached 2,000,000 francs.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_271'></a>Garibaldi had been instructed to move in the direction
of Varese by slow marches, keeping himself in constant
communication with Cialdini's division, which did not follow.
By the necessity of strategetical combinations, Gen. Cialdini
was obliged to march to and fro from Vercelli and Stroppiana,
guarding the right bank of the Upper Sesia, as far as Gattinara.
The necessary result of this constant marching and
countermarching was that of retarding the projects of Garibaldi.
He moved slowly for two days, but he could not
stand it any longer; and hastening from Romagnana to the
headquarters of the king, he begged him to observe that he
did not and could not understand the scientific principles of a
regular war, and that he wished to be left to his daring
inspiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Victor Emanuel saw directly that it was of no use to keep
such a bird in the cage of strategic rules, and, letting him
loose, said: "Go where you like, do what you like. I have
only one regret—that of not being able to follow you."</p>

<p class='c007'>While occupying the place, amidst the enthusiasm of the
inhabitants, he learned that General Urban was approaching
with forty thousand Austrians. He immediately retired
from the city, leaving two hundred men, with orders to hold
the place, with the aid of the inhabitants, to the last extremity.
The enemy came on, attacked, and were bravely
resisted, but succeeded in taking the town. Supposing that
Garibaldi had retreated into Switzerland, without any intention
of returning, they appeared to entertain no apprehensions
of danger from that quarter. It then became highly important
that he should be apprised of the condition of things.
Every effort was made to procure a messenger, and high
rewards were offered; but the hazards were so great that no
one could be found willing to run the desperate risk of his
life, or rather to go to certain death, as the Austrians were
believed to hold and watch every avenue to the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi, who was waiting in the mountains for an opportunity
to make a sudden descent upon the enemy, but cut off
<a id='Page_272'></a>from communication, and in ignorance of their situation, was
surprised in his wild retreat by the arrival of a lady, who had
come from Como alone, on horseback, by pursuing by-paths,
and with great skill and boldness, finding her way between
and around the various points which were guarded by the
enemy. Although only twenty-four years of age, brought up
in refined society, and of aristocratic family—a daughter of
Count Raimondi—this fair and youthful stranger appeared
before Garibaldi like a vision, and, with an air corresponding
with the spirit which had inspired her through her wild and
perilous expedition, presented to him the dispatches with
which she had been intrusted, at her earnest petition, in Como.
Garibaldi learned from them the position of the enemy, and the
readiness of the people to receive him again. Without a
moment's delay, he set out on his return, and by a forced
march, conducted with the greatest skill, suddenly returned
to the Lake of Como, with his resolute band.</p>

<p class='c007'>Como was occupied after a hard fight of two hours at San
Fermo and Camerlata. This last-mentioned position is to be
considered as the key of the picturesque barrier of Como, for
its elevated ground enables a small body of men to oppose a
long resistance even to an army of 15,000 strong. The
positions were carried at the point of the bayonet, for the
Cacciatori delle Alpi could not fire their muskets, so much
inferior in range to those of the enemy. It was a hard and
bloody fight, which may, without exaggeration, be compared
to the struggles of old, when Roman and Carthaginian legions
met together.</p>

<p class='c007'>The news of the organizing of a corps by the celebrated
Garibaldi, had induced the Austrians to make their last demand
upon Piedmont, which was a very extraordinary one,
and indicated the interesting truth that they duly appreciated
Garibaldi. It was, that, unless his band was immediately
dispersed, they would march forward in three days.
This demand was not complied with, but the King of Sardinia
prepared to receive the threatened invaders. With excellent
<a id='Page_273'></a>judgment, however, he did not attempt to occupy the line of
the Mincio; he chose a stronger one within his own territory,
and occupied that extending from Alessandria to the Apennines,
toward Genoa, leaving the road to Turin open to the
enemy. The Austrians moved; but, as soon as they had
crossed the Ticino, the engineer who had charge of the canals
which irrigate the extensive valley, was ordered to open them
and make an inundation. The Austrians soon discovered
that the water was rising, and the general sent word to the
engineer in terms like these:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"Your brother is a prisoner in my hands; if you do not immediately
stop the inundation, I will cut off his head."</span></p>

<p class='c006'>The engineer, with the greatest resolution, pressed the
work with redoubled vigor that night; and by employing
two hundred more men, completed it before morning. The
Austrians, finding that they were likely to be caught in a
kind of trap, with the inundation rising on their right, and
the Piedmontese army on their left, soon retreated, and recrossed
the Ticino.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE BATTLE OF PALESTRO.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>This action was important, not only on account of its resulting
in the first victory against the Austrians, but also because
of the excellence of the Piedmontese troops, which had been
denied, and was certainly seriously doubted by Louis Napoleon,
who had given to Victor Emnanuel four battalions of
French Zouaves for his body-guard. These were the only
French troops in that battle; and they so much admired the
conduct of the King of Sardinia, that they elected him
"Corporal" on the field. This is esteemed the highest
military honor which can be in any way acquired; and it is
one which Louis Napoleon himself has never yet received,
even from his own troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle of Montebello was the first ever decided by a
<a id='Page_274'></a>railroad. When the action commenced, there was only a
single regiment to resist the Austrians. This was a French
regiment, which was so soon, so rapidly, and so greatly
reinforced by other French troops, transported on the railroad,
that the day was soon decided in their favor. The
importance and effect of this manner of conveying the troops
was acknowledged by the Austrians, in their official report of
the battle.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE BATTLE OF MAGENTA.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>This was fought about twenty miles beyond the last
engagement, that of Montebello; and the chief honor of the
day belongs to the French. That battle was the first in
which rifled cannon and electrical telegraphs were ever
brought into use; and both were proved successful in the
highest degree. Louis Napoleon was the inventor of the
former; and their efficiency was strongly doubted and even
denied by many scientific and practical men; but it was established
beyond future question by the experiment of that
day. The French had also a corps of electricians among
them, with apparatus prepared for the establishment and
change of lines of telegraphic wires wherever troops were
stationed; and these proved of eminent service in conveying
orders and information between the positions.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE RIVER MINCIO.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>The banks of the Mincio are, as it were, formed for military
scenes. From the source of the river, down almost as
far as Pozzolo, the river winds through a succession of hills,
rushing close to their base on one side, and leaving fine open
meadows on the other. At some points the hills approach
on both sides, and form a kind of gorge or neutral ground,
where the river is kept within proper bounds, and not
allowed to encroach on either side. Perhaps the most picturesque
spot on the whole river is here, between Borghetto
<a id='Page_275'></a>and Vallegio. Two large semi-circles of hills are opposed to
each other, the direction of them being the bend of the river
on this spot; they intersect each other about their centre,
and a little below this point are the two villages of Borghetto
and Vallegio. The latter is behind the hills on the left
bank; only two mills, a church, and a little mediæval tower,
erected on one of the lower spurs, stand close to the water's
edge. Borghetto has, likewise, only a few detached houses
on the banks of the river, the rest of the village being built
on the hill which skirts the right bank. On the highest
point of the Vallegio side rises a most picturesque group of
towers of pure Italian castellated architecture, slender and
high like campaniles, with a gallery on their summit, built on
a succession of small arches springing out of the body of the
building. From these towers, an old wall runs down to the
banks of the river, where two other lower, but more massive,
towers stand, with the ruins of a bridge over the river between
them. From the second of these towers, the wall
runs up to the hill where Borghetto stands, and ends there
in another square tower. This castle, as well as the surrounding
domain, belongs to the Visconti family, and the
fortifications were evidently intended to close the passage of
the river, which they may have done at one time; now they
form only a picturesque feature in the scenery. The road
from Volta to this place descends along the hillside in a gentle
slope, and, after traversing the river, winds up in a similar
but much steeper rise, so that you can keep in view the
whole passage through the valley. On the right bank of the
river extends a fine meadow, through which the road leads.
It was now the camping-ground of the Cavalry of the Guard,
and was, during the passage, a chaos of troops, horses, carts,
and mules, which were huddled together there, waiting for a
passage across one of the four bridges which span the narrow
but rapid little stream. It was like the emigration of one of
those nomadic tribes of which history tells us. It seemed for
a moment as if it were impossible to disentangle that mass,
<a id='Page_276'></a>and yet it kept moving, and passed over the river without
accident or delay. As all the bridges which had been broken
down on the river behind had been repaired, the pontoon
train of the whole army became available for the Mincio
passage, and there must have been, at the very least, from 12
to 15 bridges on this short line.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE BATTLE OF SOLFERINO.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>The Austrian army, after occupying the right bank of the
Mincio, had retired across the stream, in order to lead the
French and Sardinians to believe that they were retreating.
When the latter had extended their lines, the Austrians suddenly
returned and reoccupied their old formidable positions
on the heights of Solferino, San Cassiano, and Cavriana, and
onward to Volta, all crowned with cannon. Their lines extended
five leagues. This movement was made in the night
of June 23d, and at three o'clock in the morning they were
discovered, in large bodies, marching across the plain to
attack the allies.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 24th, the emperor, who had arrived just before,
ordered the Sardinian army (which formed the left wing) to
occupy Pozzolengo, and the French to occupy Solferino and
Cavriana. The king also sent a detachment toward Peschiera.
The Austrians resisted them powerfully. At ten
o'clock the battle became general, and was continued during
a severe storm. After twelve hours fighting, the Austrians
brought up their reserve of 80,000 men, and the allies theirs
of 50,000. After three more hours of severe fighting, the
heights were taken by the allies, and the Austrians retreated.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1796, Solferino was the point most strenuously contested
and won by Augereau. On this occasion that position
was taken three times by the French, and the last time at
the point of the bayonet. The Emperor of Austria commanded
in person, and greatly animated his troops, who
<a id='Page_277'></a>fought well. After they had been driven from Solferino,
they made a powerful concentrated attack on the right
wing of the allies, but were repulsed by a dash of cavalry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the allies were victorious, they were unable to
pursue the enemy, who retreated in good order.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE AUSTRIAN OFFICIAL ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE OF SOLFERINO.</b></h4>

<p class='c019'>The official journal at Vienna, of June 26, published the
following official dispatch from the seat of war:</p>
<div class='c024'>"<span class='sc'>Verona</span>, <i>Saturday, June 25</i>.</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"On the 23d inst., the imperial royal army crossed at four places
to the right bank of the Mincio. The right wing of the army occupied
Pozzolengo, Solferino, and Cavriana. The left wing marched on
the 24th inst. to Guidizzolo and Castel-Goffredo, and repulsed the
advancing enemy on all sides. As the Imperial Royal army continued
its advance toward the Chiese, the enemy—who had also
assumed the offensive with his whole force—pushed forward such
large bodies of troops, that there was a general engagement between
the two armies at ten o'clock, or thereabouts, in the morning of the
24th instant.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The right wing, which was formed by the second army, under
the general of cavalry, Count Schlick, maintained possession of the
place which it had originally occupied in the first line of battle until
2 o'clock in the afternoon, and the first army (the left wing), under
the general of artillery, Count Wimpffen, continually gained ground
in the direction of the Chiese. Toward 3 o'clock the enemy made a
vehement attack on Solferino, and after several hours' hard fighting,
obtained possession of the place, which had been heroically defended
by the fifth <i>corps d'armée</i>. An attack was then made on Cavriana,
which place was courageously defended until the evening by the first
and seventh <i>corps d'armée</i>, but was eventually left in the hands
of the enemy.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"While the struggle for Solferino and Cavriana was going on, the
eighth <i>corps d'armée</i>, which was on the outer flank of the right
wing, advanced and repulsed the Sardinian troops opposed to it: but
this advantage did not enable the Imperial Royal army to recover the
positions that had been lost in the centre. The third and ninth
corps, which were supported by the eleventh corps, were engaged on
the left wing, and the reserve cavalry attached to this wing made
<a id='Page_278'></a>several brilliant attacks. Unusually heavy losses, and the fact that
the left wing of the first army was unable to make progress on the
right flank of the enemy, who directed his main force in the centre
against Volta, led to the retreat of the Imperial Royal army. It
began late in the evening, during a violent storm. Yesterday evening
Pozzolengo, Monzambano, Volta and Goito, were still occupied
by our troops."</span></p>

<h3 class='c001'><span class='large'><b>CHAPTER IV.</b></span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>THE STATE OF THE CONTENDING PARTIES—SPECIMEN OF
THE BARBARITY OF SOME OF THE AUSTRIAN OFFICERS—THE
ARMISTICE.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>The Austrian army, with its imposing numbers, high military
reputation, and menacing attitude a few weeks before, when
threatening and afterward invading Piedmont, from the line
of the Mincio, had now become vastly weakened, reduced,
and disheartened by the successive conflicts and defeats which
have been briefly described. The causes of its misfortunes
have been accounted for, by an eye-witness, in remarks which
we abridge as follows:</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"The Austrian military system has been changed completely within
the last six or seven years; yet the change in part explains the
shortcomings of the past few weeks. The Austrian army, up to this
date, has been an army of very young soldiers, not long under training.
According to the regulations, a fixed number of corps has to be
maintained throughout the Austrian empire. At a fixed period of every
year the youth of that empire are drafted into the army, and
distributed among the corps. The arrival of these new drafts
liberates an equal number of men who have already served. The
latter, after one, or two, or three years' service, at the option
of the colonels of regiments, retire to their homes on a furlough
of indefinite duration, and are only called out again in the event
of a war. The Austrian army at Montebello, Palestro, Magenta, and
Cavriana was thus composed of young soldiers. It would have been wiser,
doubtless, had the Austrians thought of this matter in time. They
were aware that Louis Napoleon would move, if he moved at all, with
the flower of his army. They knew that he had paid high premiums to
induce old soldiers to remain in the ranks after the expiration of
their usual time, and that the picked men of the French army, tried
under the fierce sun of Africa, and in the hard campaign of the Crimea,
would be opposed to them, and be assisted besides by an artillery of
a novel and most effective kind. They did not take sufficient heed
<a id='Page_280'></a>of these important facts, any more than they considered that generals
who, ten years ago, fought with ability and success in the campaigns
of Italy might possibly have lost some of their original vigor. The
result has been such as to open their eyes to the necessity of
supplying defects. The question, as far as the present war is concerned,
is this: Which is best, to risk all the tried men first, and trust to
recruits after, or employ first the young soldiers, and bring up
reserves after? As far as the present campaign is concerned, the results
favor the first of these alternatives.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The advisers of his Imperial Majesty Francis Joseph, at last made
up their minds that it was impossible, under present circumstances, to
defend the line of the Mincio. Accordingly, the headquarters of the
2d Army, under Count Schlick, came into Verona from Villafranca;
the headquarters of the 1st Army, under Wimpffen, being transferred
to Mantua. Verona, Mantua, and the other strongholds of this great
military quadrangle are very much stronger than they were ten years
ago. There are great field works to be taken before any approach
can be made to the main defences, and in the meanwhile Austria may
have brought together again an army capable of risking another general
action. The soldiers had one moment of enthusiasm; that was
when the emperor led them in person on the 23d to the advanced
position from which he intended to attack the enemy; but the events
of the 24th seriously affected the <i>morale</i> of the army. Instead of
attacking, as they were led to expect, they had to repel the assaults
of the Allies, who knowing what was before them, had halted for a
meal at two o'clock in the morning. The Austrians, whose baggage
and cooking utensils accompany the columns even in the advance,
bivouacked on the night of the 23d, and were attacked before they could
get their breakfast. The baggage and cooking-carts were obliged to
return to the rear out of the fire of the Allies, and the result was
that the army of the Kaiser had to fight on empty stomachs. Hunger and
hard knocks have a tendency to discourage even the bravest soldier. I
was astonished to see men from the field of Solferino retiring
unwounded, and lying down exhausted when out of the reach of the
enemy's fire. I am told that many so exhausted laid themselves down
only to die. The mystery is explained when one considers that these
cases arose from want of ordinary sustenance.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Lichtenstein's corps (the 2d) which should have taken part in
the action of the day, was halted in consequence of the approach of
some French cavalry in its vicinity, and Prince Lichtenstein, for
reasons which he will doubtless have to explain, returned to Mantua.
Again, General Zedwitz, commanding the cavalry brigade of the 1st
<a id='Page_281'></a>Army, instead of advancing, as he should have done, fell back on
Goito, thus depriving the emperor of six regiments of horse and a
considerable amount of artillery. Thus, while on the part of the
allies all the available guns that could be brought into action were
used, on the side of the Austrians the artillery was weak and utterly
unable to oppose an effectual fire to that of the enemy. It is true, on
the other hand, that the French artillery did not commit the havoc
which it might have done had its fire throughout the day been
true to the mark, instead of being over it. Still, the effect of the
inferiority under which the Austrians suffered in this respect, was
disastrous, as it prevented them from repelling the advance of the
infantry opposed to them. Among the wounded, to the number of 4,000 or
5,000 in Verona and the surrounding villages, it is remarkable
how few suffered from wounds inflicted by artillery."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>In contrast with the condition of the Austrian army, those
of Piedmont and France were in most respects superior, and
still more in the principles for which they fought. To mention
again Napoleon's rifled cannon, in the words of a late
writer:</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"The superiority of the French artillery during the late Italian
campaign was obvious to every one who made himself acquainted with
the details of the great battles. At Solferino the heavy and very
dangerous Austrian cavalry was thrown into disorder and rendered
almost useless at distances to which their own batteries, more favorably
placed, would not carry. The Austrians never yielded a foot on the
hill of Solferino, till a battery of French rifled cannon was brought
to bear upon them at a distance at which their own balls fell short.
The Tower could not have otherwise been taken but with an infinitely
greater slaughter than that which occurred. When Niel and McMahon
had driven the Austrians back as far as the large open space
known as the plain of Guidizzolo, there was a fair trial of artillery,
which cost the Austrians dear; it was the last stand made by the immense
left wing of the Austrian army, and one can well imagine how officers
and men grew dispirited in face of artillery that silenced their
own wherever it showed itself."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>The following remarks on the plans and conduct of the war
we abridge from the "London Times," of July 8th, 1860:</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"As far as the Allies are concerned, their aim was driving the
Austrians out of Italy. With this aim clearly and distinctly before
<a id='Page_282'></a>them, the difficulties and chances could be more or less calculated in
advance, and all that vagueness and uncertainty avoided which gives
rise to those useless moves in two armies, neither of which knows
what it is to do next.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The Austrians were in this latter case when they began the war,
nobody knew why, and while they were allowed to amuse themselves
with their harmless offensive movements you saw all those insignificant
skirmishes occur on the Sesia, which were put a speedy end
to by the advance of the Allies. Since that time the war has been
rolling along in great waves. The Allies went straight toward their
aim, and the Austrians were so hard pressed, that they endeavored
to oppose to a grand plan, executed with the most determined will,
equally grand operations.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Thus, when the Austrians found themselves outwitted by the
flank movement on the Ticino, they brought up their troops in all
haste to oppose the advance. They were beaten, and immediately
resolved to withdraw behind the Mincio. The fight at Malegnano
only took place in order to insure this retreat, but from that time
they avoided opposing the advance of the Allies, by making a stand at
the river lines. On the other hand, the Allies, intent only on carrying
out their own great plans, did not think for one moment of
molesting their retreat.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"After the Allies had crossed the Chiese, and made preparations
for the passage of the Mincio, the Austrians attempted one great
blow; and, collecting all their forces, tried an offensive movement,
which was speedily checked by the battle of Solferino. The battle
lost, the French, whose preparations were not completed, did not
press the retreating Austrians very hard; while these latter, instead
of trying a desultory defence of the Mincio, opposed no resistance to
the passage of it, but, without wasting any forces, retired between
Peschiera and Verona, to await there the attack of the Allies, or
perhaps watch their time for another great offensive movement.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"This avoiding on both sides of those little encounters, deprives
the war considerably of its picturesque element of its individual
features, as it were. This whole campaign resolves itself into an
alternation between preparations and great decisive blows.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The Mincio passage was effected without any difficulty, offering by
its good arrangements matter of thought to the military, but otherwise
being a subject rather for a landscape painter than for a painter
of battles. Although the Austrians had gone back from the river,
all the precautions were taken as if there had been a constant danger
from an attack. The whole had very much the appearance of a field
<a id='Page_283'></a>manœuvre in peaceable times, with the difference, however, that even
the thin line representing the hostile forces on such occasions, was
entirely wanting. But the movements had to be so combined, that
the army should be in readiness to receive the enemy in case he came
down from his position between Verona and Peschiera. The enemy's
position was on the left flank of the allied armies, facing the Mincio,
with Peschiera just at the angle formed by the intersection of the
Mincio with his extreme right. The Allies were thus obliged, while
crossing the Mincio, to change their front and face to the left. For
this purpose the Sardinians, who had kept the position of San Martino,
took up the line from Rivoltella, on the lake, in the neighborhood
of Pozzolengo. The 1st French corps, which had been next to
them in the <i>ordre de bataille</i> of the 27th, marched to Pozzolengo,
and, occupying Ponti, faced against Peschiera. The 2d corps,
next to it, kept its original direction toward the Mincio, joining the
1st corps at Castellaro, where the road leads down to Monzambano.
To the right of this corps was the 4th, at Volta, likewise facing the
Mincio, and the 3d at Goito. The crossing took place at almost all
points simultaneously, with just sufficient interval between the corps
to allow time for that furthest to the right to accomplish its change
of front, and come into the same direction with the others. Thus,
the 4th corps, which was furthest, with the exception of the 3d,
detached toward Goito, was the first to cross at Borghetto and
Vallegio, to gain the high road to Verona, and take up its position
toward Villafranca. This was on the morning of the 29th. Since
that time, all the corps have crossed successively, changing their
direction from west to east, and making front against the Austrian
position.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"While we are discussing the progress of the plot and speculating
as to the nature of the catastrophe, the curtain falls. Yesterday
France and Austria were upon the point of joining in another
desperate battle. The celebrated fortified Quadrangle had been
reached, Peschiera had been invested, Mantua had been masked,
Verona was upon the point of being summoned, Venice was
threatened, and Garibaldi was manœuvering upon the rear of the
great fortresses. The waves of warfare were undulating and
vibrating to another great burst in foam. To-day the Spirit of Peace
has breathed upon the waters, and the storm is for the moment at
an end. Three months ago we expected peace and were surprised
by war. To-day Europe was waiting in breathless expectation for a
great battle, fought in the very fortresses of Austria, and is again
surprised by the calm announcement that an armistice has been
<a id='Page_284'></a>concluded, and that the two great armies are for the moment no longer
enemies."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>The cruelties practised by Austrians in Italy will be
disgraceful to the memory of their government, its officers
and soldiers. A single instance of the crimes of General
Urban, in Lombardy, in 1859, will suffice. By his order, a
whole family were butchered. It consisted of seven persons,
including a grandfather, eighty-two years of age, a boy of
fourteen, and a girl of twelve. Merely for the purpose of
striking terror into the people; it appears, and without any
pretext of fault in them, he had them all put to death, and
left their mangled corpses unburied. This atrocious act has
been denied; but the king's government have since instituted
a regular legal investigation, ascertained its truth, and
erected a monument in memory of it.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE ARMISTICE.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>The war, its progress, results, and prospects were not less
unexpected or surprising than the armistice which Louis
Napoleon, without any warning, suddenly concluded, in an
interview with the Emperor of Austria, on the 11th of July.
The cause of it still remains a matter of conjecture. It was
followed by a treaty, by which the war was terminated and
harmony restored, but the promise of Louis not fulfilled, of
driving out the foreigners from Italy. Austria was left in
possession of the four great fortresses of Lombardy, as well
as of Venetia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The armistice was first announced to France by the following
telegram:</p>

<div class='c024'>"<span class='sc'>Vallegio</span>, <i>July 11, 1859.</i></div>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The bases agreed to are an Italian confederation, under the honorary

Italy is about to become for the first time a nation. A confederation

will, nevertheless, be an Italian province, constituting a part of the
confederation.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The union of Lombardy with Piedmont creates for us on this
side of the Alps a powerful ally, who will owe to us his independence.

necessity of salutary reforms. A general amnesty will cause to disappear
the traces of civil discord. Italy, henceforth mistress of her
destinies, will only have to blame herself if she do not regularly
progress in order and liberty.</span></p>

with transport those soldiers who have borne so high the glory
of our arms at Montebello, Palestro, Turbigo, Magenta, Mariguan,

Lombardy, and only paused because the struggle was about to assume

<p class='c006'>The following considerations are suggested by the peace
just concluded:</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_286'></a>The cession of Lombardy to Piedmont comprehends that
of the two fortresses, Mantua and Peschiera. The superfices
of Lombardy is 8,538 square miles. Its population is
2,800,000 souls. Lombardy has hitherto been divided,
administratively, into nine provinces or delegations, viz.:—Milan,
Pavia, Lodi, Corma, Cremona, Como, Mantua, Sondrio,
Breschia, and Bergamo. The fortified towns of Mantua
and Peschiera form part of the province of Mantua. The
fortress of Pezzighettone is comprised in the province of
Cremona. After the annexation of Lombardy and Piedmont,
this kingdom (the island of Sardinia both included)
will contain a superfices of 37,640 square miles, with a population
of 7,800,000. As regards territorial extent, it will
occupy a tenth rank in Europe, and will come immediately
after the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and before Portugal
and Bavaria. With respect to population, Sardinia will
stand in the ninth rank, on a level with Naples, and will be
above Sweden and Norway, Belgium, and Bavaria.</p>

DISPLAYED BY EXILES IN THE UNITED STATES—IGNORANCE OF
ITALY IN AMERICA—GARIBALDI'S APPEARANCE AND CHARACTER
—HIS BAND—HIS "ENGLISHMAN," COL. PEARD.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>And now that we have arrived at another peaceful interval
in the life of this extraordinary man, the astonishing effects
of his superior skill, bravery, and success, having broken the
arm of Austria in Italy, and nothing but the shield of Louis
Napoleon having sheltered her head, a sudden suspension of
hostilities left the world at leisure to admire the past, feel
astounded at the unexpected present state of things, and
look with interest, but painful uncertainty, for the future.
All observers, who had not before made Italy or Italians
their attentive study, were anxious to know more of the
people who had suddenly sprung from a low general estimation
as patriots and soldiers, to the rank due to the conquerors
at Palestro, Montebello, and Solferino, and had furnished
the files of the heroic and irresistible hunters of the
Alps, and their leader, Garibaldi himself. Let us turn a
few moments to inquiries of the same kind; for even at the
present time, there is too much reason to fear, there are few,
even of our most intelligent countrymen, who have paid
sufficient attention to the affairs of Italy during the past
half century, to give full and clear replies to these questions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few indeed have had the best opportunities to learn the
<a id='Page_288'></a>general truths, and fewer still have had access to many of
those details, by which alone the causes can be well understood,
and the effects clearly accounted for. The published
accounts of Italians and their affairs have been presented
to the world in a detached, uncertain and often confused
and even contradictory form, which most readers had neither
the disposition, the time, nor the means to unravel, reconcile
and correct. There have always been, however, intelligent
and virtuous patriotic Italians residing in the United States,
and especially in New York, who were able and ready to communicate
real facts and just opinions on every event and
question of importance. And to such are justly due some
portion of the facts contained in this volume, and of the
views and spirit under which they are now laid before the
American people. With their assistance, and at their
urgent request also, was done the little which has ever been
effected in this country in past years, to explain and vindicate
their cause, to relieve its exiled victims, to expose the
insidious intrigues of their enemies against American institutions,
and to invite and foster mutual acquaintance, and
brotherly affection and coöperation between us and the
noble patriots of Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Americans have but one excuse to give for their neglect
of Italy in her more triumphant struggle against her combined
enemies and oppressors.  The intrigues of her enemies
and their insidious calumnies were sufficient to mislead the
incautious and the honest. But we have long since lost the
spirit of our Protestant ancestors, who were men of clearer
sight, greater knowledge, stronger judgment, and more
resolution, bravery and perseverance than their descendants.
They distinguished, as we do not, between great truths and
great falsehoods; between great rights and great wrongs;
and acted with promptitude and vigor whenever the time
arrived to vindicate or secure the one, and to expose and
counteract the other. And such a spirit was displayed by
the Italian exiles on our soil. They set us examples of
<a id='Page_289'></a>similar ways of thinking, speaking and acting; and well
would it have been if we had rightly appreciated the knowledge
which they possessed, the manly views which they
entertained, and the plans which they proposed for our
mutual benefit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following description of Garibaldi we translate from
the "History of the Glorious Campaign of the Cacciatori
delle Alpi, in the war of 1859," by one of his officers, Col.
Francesco Corrano:</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"Giuseppe Garibaldi is of middle stature, with broad and square
shoulders, herculean limbs, long brownish hair, and beard slightly
grey; a heavy and strong step, sailor-like air, look, and manner of
speaking; his vest buttoned up to his throat, a hat with a broad
brim, in the Calabrian style, and large trousers. The noises of the
city annoy and disturb him. Commanding mountains please him,
covered with evergreen trees, and the sight of the vast horizon and
the boundless sea.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"His nose is straight and almost vertical, and his aspect at once
vivacious and sweet. Often, under his very heavy beard, his lips are
gently moved by a natural and fascinating smile. He converses
frankly and unaffectedly, condemns with decision, and praises warmly
but briefly; but he is ever animated, fluent, and even eloquent,
whenever the conversation turns on Italy, liberty, and deeds of daring
and skill; to overcome the enemy, and to overdo them (<i>sopraffare</i>),
his favorite word. Above all things, he prizes faithfulness and valor
in chivalrous warfare, though it be not accompanied by fame or
popular applause. Proud despiser of pay and money, he loves Italy
above all things.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Cuneo, who is called his friend for life, by Garibaldi himself,
writes of him: 'A man of humanity, he is laboring to secure in the
future the brotherhood of the people; but at the banquet of nations he
will sit only as an equal, or not sit at all.' He is by nature tolerant
of every suggestion. He has trust and sympathy in discipline
produced by love, more than by the rigor of laws.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"It would be difficult to find a successor to Garibaldi. His name
is popular in Italy, through all Europe, and in America also, as no
other is in our day; and it was owing chiefly to his name, that ten
thousand Italians, from every province in the country, and in a short
space of time, hastened to join him, and to write their names as
'Cacciatori delle Alpi.' But, more than to command battalions, he
<a id='Page_290'></a>is fitted to lead them in fine order; prepared to fight, and with
ten-fold moral force, by his terrible name, to overcome and scatter
the enemy; to conquer or to fall with signal honor."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>The intelligence and respectability of Garibaldi's soldiers
were attested by an English gentleman who visited his camp
at Firano, August 5th. He wrote:</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"You are already aware that in this singular corps the soldier generally
belongs to the best class of Italian society. In consequence of this
peculiarity, each of this gallant band is a politician of the first
class. The doings of our ministers are sensibly discussed in these
bivouacs.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The only Englishman who is among them has become the lion of
this singular corps. In my former letter I had occasion to speak of
Captain Peard, the gentleman in question. He comes from Cornwall,
and belongs to a militia regiment, whose uniform he wears with a
decidedly martial bearing. He is a man of tall and colossal frame,
nearer sixty than fifty, and is considered the best shot in the party.
Although he has been attached to Garibaldi's staff, he makes war at
his own expense, and he was always to be found in the thick of the
fray. Whenever he had killed an Austrian, he was seen to mark him
down in his pocket-book. A few days ago I met Captain Peard at
Brescia, and he was kind enough to show me his book, from which it
was apparent that twenty-five Austrians were killed by him during
the campaign, besides ten who were under the head of 'uncertain.'</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"There are also with Garibaldi two rather eccentric young Frenchmen,
dressed in a peculiar costume of their own, who are members of
the Paris Jockey Club. These two gentlemen have been so charmed by
the gallant general, that I am told they will share his fate, whatever
it may be. <i>Five American citizens</i>, and a few Germans, are
going to do the same, together with a Chinese, who, were I to believe
what he told me, is one of the few who escaped the slaughter of
Commissioner Yeh at Canton. Most of Garibaldi's officers belong
to the upper classes of Lombardy, and have borne arms with him
either in South America or in Rome."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>The interval which occurred between the day of Garibaldi's
departure from Turin, with his <i>Alpine Huntsmen</i>, and the
dispersion of the forty thousand Austrians at Calatrava, is
one of the most interesting and important in modern history.
While the most anxious fears prevailed among his friends,
<a id='Page_291'></a>and the most alarming reports were circulated by his enemies;
while the promise of being supported by the number
of troops which he had thought indispensable was entirely
disappointed, by the inability of Cialdini to cross the rivers,
Garibaldi, as we have seen, undismayed by that and other
difficulties, pursued his way with unfailing resolution and
complete success. He raised the country in insurrection
wherever he went; kindled a flame in every heart from the
electric fire which had so long been cherished in his own;
unhesitatingly attacked the opposing hosts of the enemy, and
put them all to flight. Thus he alarmed, weakened, and
terrified the invaders, and animated the Allies, whose precursor
he was; gave an impulse to the war at the commencement,
and a most powerful support to it till the close, which
will ever secure to him an indisputable claim to a large, a
very large, share of the victory and its results. This claim,
we may surely foretell, will never be made by himself. It
will, however, be made by the world—by mankind—on whom
he has conferred the inestimable benefits of his great deeds,
and his pure and noble example. Such concurrences and
successions of events, such men as have been employed in the
various scenes, and especially such a heroic leader, could have
been devised only by infinite wisdom, and conducted to such
results only by an Almighty hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the interesting scenes described in the last chapter,
Garibaldi went to Rimini, and took command of an army
which had been collected there, to resist General Lamoricière,
who was at Pesaro, 22 miles distant, that French general,
commanding the Pope's troops, being menaced by Garibaldi's
position, who was said to be urgent for permission to pass at
once through the Pope's territory into the Abruzzo, and
raise the Neapolitans in insurrection against their cruel old
king, Bomba.</p>

<p class='c007'>Victor Emanuel, disapproving such a movement at that
time, wrote to Garibaldi, requesting him to resign his command,
with which he complied; and General Fanti received
it in his stead. He then proceeded to Piedmont, where he
published the following manifesto:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><b>"TO MY COMPANIONS IN ARMS IN CENTRAL ITALY.</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"Let not my temporary absence cool your ardor for the holy cause
that we defend.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"In separating myself from you, whom I love as the representatives
of a sublime idea—the idea of Italian deliverance—I am excited
and sad; but consolation comes in the certainty that I shall very soon
<a id='Page_293'></a>be among you again, to aid you in finishing the work so gloriously
begun.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"For you, as for me, the greatest of all possible misfortunes would
be not to be present wherever there is fighting for Italy. Young
men who have sworn to be faithful to Italy and to the chief who will
lead you to victory, lay not down your arms; remain firm at your
post—continue your exercises—persevere in the soldier's discipline.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The truce will not last long; old diplomacy seems but little disposed
to see things as they really are. Diplomacy still looks upon
you as the handful of malcontents which she had been accustomed to
despise. She does not know that in you there are the elements of a
great nation, and that in your free and independent hearts there
germinate the seeds of a world-wide revolution if our rights shall not
be recognized, and if people will not allow us to be masters in our own
home.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"We desire to invade no foreign soil; let us remain unmolested on
our own. Whosoever attempts to gainsay this our determination will
find that we will never be slaves, unless they succeed in crushing by
force an entire people ready to die for liberty.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"But, even should we all fall, we shall bequeath to future generations
a legacy of hatred and vengeance against foreign domination; the
inheritance of each of our sons will be a rifle, and the consciousness
of his rights; and by the blessing of God, the oppressor will
never sleep soundly.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Italians, I say again, do not lay down your arms; rally more
closely than ever to your chiefs, and maintain the strictest discipline.
Fellow-citizens, let not a man in Italy omit to contribute his mite to
the national subscription; let not one fail to clean his gun, so as to
be ready, perhaps to-morrow, to obtain by force that which to-day
they hesitate to grant to our just rights.</span></p>

<div class='c023'>"<span class='sc'>Garibaldi.</span></div>

<p class='c022'>"<span class='sc'>Genoa</span>, <i>Nov. 23, 1859</i>."</p>
<p class='c006'>Garibaldi then proceeded to Turin, and took his seat as a
member of the Sardinian Parliament, to which he had been
elected two years before, as the representative of Nice, his
native country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis Napoleon having proposed that Savoy and Nice
should be ceded to France, the subject was brought before
the Parliament and discussed at length, Garibaldi opposing
the project with great zeal in several very animated speeches.
<a id='Page_294'></a>The conduct of Napoleon, in 1849, against Rome, may
easily account for his feelings on that occasion. He soon
withdrew from the chamber, and departed for Caprera, where
he remained until a new scene was opened to him in another
quarter, where Providence was preparing for him to make
that display of his noble character and superior powers,
which now has gained him the warmest love, as well as the
highest admiration, of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sicilians, unable any longer to suppress their discontent
under the cruel government of the king, began, in April,
1860, once more to show signs of rebellion. An insurrection
was made in Palermo, when the people raised barricades in
the streets, and fought the troops with resolution. The
combat was very bloody, but the citizens were soon overcome,
and most of the insurgents perished at the barricades.
Several monks of the convents were seized and imprisoned.
Reinforcements had been sent into Sicily. The commercial
steamboats had been put into requisition, and the army in
Sicily was to be augmented to 30,000 men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prince Castilcicala had returned to his post as governor
of the island. The panic at Naples on the 6th instant was
general, but without consequence. On the evening of the
6th an immense crowd, estimated to number 80,000, blocked
up the Rue Tolede at Naples, and raised numerous shouts
of "<i>Viva la Constituzione</i>" before the residence of the Papal
Nuncio. The street was quickly cleared by the patrols.</p>

<p class='c007'>Palermo had been placed in a state of siege. The insurgents
were said to number 10,000 well armed men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The insurrection at Messina broke out on Sunday morning,
April 11th. The popular movement commenced by
shots being fired in the strada Ferdinando. Pieces of furniture
were thrown from the windows at the troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>Count Cavour had telegraphed to Leghorn, ordering two
steam frigates to proceed at once toward the coast of Sicily,
and shelter all fugitives from political vengeance. The cry
<a id='Page_295'></a>at Palermo, as well as at Messina, was for union with the
Italian kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disturbances increased, and the Sicilians rose in different
places, fought bravely, and maintained themselves with
great resolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi was urgently called to their assistance, and was
soon in Piedmont collecting men for an expedition. Great
enthusiasm was displayed. Many volunteers pressed forward,
and considerable numbers of soldiers deserted from the
king's army to join their favorite leader. The government
and its agents affected not to perceive the movement, and
no impediment was thrown in its way. Vessels were prepared
at the little port of Cagliari, and the volunteers, collected
at convenient points not far distant, marched quietly
to the shore, embarked, and sailed in the night of the 6th of
May.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the events which followed this first step in the last
grand drama of Italian history are fresh in the minds of all,
the following brief review of them, recently published by the
Paris "Siècle," may not be out of place here:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"A man, accompanied by a few volunteers, sails from the environs
of Genoa in the night of the 6th of May, on board of a vessel which
is not even his own property. He goes to liberate several millions of
oppressed people, and to overthrow a powerful monarchy; he is
stigmatized as a brigand, and all the penalties inflicted on pirates
are invoked on his devoted head; the cry is raised that both he and his
followers might be hanged from the yard-arms of their vessel. On
the 7th of September this man has almost accomplished the task he
had undertaken; the monarchy he assailed is <i>de facto</i> overthrown.
A nation is delivered. Now, which are the wise counsellors? Those
who advise sovereigns to make concessions to the spirit of the age,
or the flatterers who promise them a protracted reign, if they will but
resist all progress? The answer is easy now. The king of Naples is
a fugitive. Another dynasty has fallen, though surrounded by
soldiers, and well provided with cannon and gold; another hope of
the counter-revolutionists has fallen away. But the men bent on the
<a id='Page_296'></a>ruin of princes still persist in giving the same pernicious counsels.
'The King of Naples has fallen,' say they, 'but General de Lamoricière
still remains; he will fight, he will; he is ready, and the revolution
will be overcome.' Wretched counsellors! They are not yet
satisfied with their work; they want more catastrophes. Nevertheless,
how easy the dynasty of Naples might have escaped destruction!
Warnings were not wanting. Four years ago, during the
Conferences of Paris, did not Europe, by the voice of her diplomatists,
unanimously declare to the King of Naples that he was courting
destruction by his bad government—that he was gathering around
him all the elements of revolution? Was he not, in a manner, implored
to adopt a different policy? Was he not duly informed of the
abyss that lay before him?</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The general success of the Italian leader is thus summed up: Five
marvellous stages—Marsala, Palermo, Milazzo, Reggio and Naples—performed
in the short space of three months, have been all that
Garibaldi required, supported as he is by the national sentiment, to
overthrow a monarchy deemed immovable; which, not yet four years
since, defied France and England; which, in the face of the naval
preparations of the two greatest powers in the world, had determined
to persevere in its resistance."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>The modern history of Sicily requires a particular study
before the sufferings and the spirit of its inhabitants can be
well understood. The cruelty of the government and its
agents have surpassed belief. The people, although few,
compared with the numbers which that large and fertile
island might sustain under a better government, have made
repeated and strenuous efforts to obtain their freedom, and
submitted only to overwhelming and irresistible force. They
commenced the Italian revolution in 1820; and on several
subsequent occasions they boldly commenced insurrections, but
always with ill success. The king of the Two Sicilies would
send troops from Naples, and then his immediate subjects
would endeavor to take advantage of the opportunity.
Sometimes the Sicilians rose against the king's troops, in
secret concert with arrangements made in other parts of Italy,
and sometimes, as it seemed, independently. Bloody scenes
followed the victories of the king's troops, but some fugitives
<a id='Page_297'></a>were always able to escape, and numbers lived in New York
and other parts of the United States—some ever since 1820
or 1822.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sicily, as described by recent Italian authorities, contains
about two thirds as many inhabitants as the State of New
York, or a little over two millions, and a territory of 26,582,59
kilometers. A chain of mountains through the northern
part appears to be a continuation of the Appenines, and the
highest peak is the volcano of Etna, otherwise called Mongibello.
The island is the largest in the Mediterranean,
extending from N. latitude 36° to 38° 8´, and E. longitude
10° 5´ to 13° 20´. It has always been celebrated for the
fertility of its soil, and was long called the granary of Rome.
It contains several provinces, named from their chief cities
Palermo, Messina, Catania, Trappani, Syracuse or Boto,
Girgenti and Caltanissetta. The city of Palermo has
483,206 inhabitants; Catania, 56,515; Messina, 93,822;
and Syracuse, 16,916. The land is but little divided, and all
the province of Trappani is possessed by only three proprietors.
In consequence of bad government, Sicily has only
126 persons to a square kilometer, and the rest of the late
kingdom of Naples 87, while Tuscany has 126. In 20 years,
under a free government, it may double its population.
There were, last year, in Sicily, 17,000 secular priests, 7,591
monks, and 8,675 nuns. Total, 33,976 drones in the hive.
Many of those joyfully joined the revolution on Garibaldi's
appearance, and gave money from their treasures, and offered
their church bells to melt into cannon, preached, and even
fought for liberty and Victor Emanuel.</p>

TALAMONE, IN TUSCANY—PROCEED TO MARSALA—LANDING—MARCH
—OCCURRENCES ON THE WAY TO PALERMO.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>For the following interesting accounts of Garibaldi's expedition
to Sicily, its arrival and operations, we copy from
some letters published in English papers. Being written on
the spot, by intelligent eye-witnesses, they are well adapted
to our use:</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>DEPARTURE OF THE EXPEDITION.</b></h4>
<p class='c029'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi left the neighborhood of Genoa on the night of the
5th of May. His intention had been to leave the day before, but
owing to the non-arrival of one of the steamers singled out for the
expedition, he had to defer it to the next day. It is useless to say
that the thorny part of the transaction had been arranged beforehand
with the owners of the steamers, and that Garibaldi merely
consented to take upon himself the responsibility of carrying off the
steamers. The captain, engineers and crew had received notice to
leave them, the gallant general being himself a good sailor, and having
plenty of men of his own to sail and handle the ships. On the
7th a landing took place on the coast of Tuscany, at Talamone, and
on the 8th, another, at Orbitello, which detained the expedition the
next day. On the evening of the 9th, the expedition set out for the
coast of Sicily direct. The Neapolitan government was perfectly well
informed, and the fleet was cruising about in all directions except the
right one. Little squadrons of two or more steamers had been
concentrated in the chief seaport towns of the island, and tried by
cruising to keep a <i>cordon</i> round the island. The south and
southwesterly coasts were, above all, a point of their attention, for
<a id='Page_299'></a>some of their ships reported having seen the expedition going toward
Tunis. Two steamers, the Capri and Stromboli, were lying at Marsala,
and not two hours before the arrival of the expedition, had
gone out for a cruise."</span></p>

<h4 class='c014'><b>THE LANDING.</b></h4>

<p class='c029'><span class='small'>"The place for landing had not been fixed beforehand; an inspiration
of the moment induced Garibaldi to choose the most frequented
part of that side of the island, and his star led him there just in the
interval which occurred between the going out and returning of the
steamers. Had it not been for this the landing might have failed.
One of the steamers struck on a rock just at the entrance of the
port, while the other went in as close as possible. The information
received, was that there was a garrison of 600 men at Marsala, and
the orders had already been given to land a small party and dislodge
them from the barracks, when the boats from the shore came off
with the news that no one was there. This made the landing easy
enough; large barges were brought alongside, and took everything
ashore; but when everything was landed, the Neapolitans made their
appearance, and began firing to their hearts' content, without doing
more than wounding slightly two men.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The first thing was to cut the telegraph wire, but it was too late
to prevent it from transmitting the news of the landing to Palermo.
The last two messages were: 'Two steamers in sight making for the
port; suspicious, as they carry no flag;' and then: 'The two steamers
having hoisted the Sardinian flag, have come in and are landing
their men.'"</span></p>
<p class='c006'>Another eye-witness, writing from Marsala, May 12th,
thus describes the landing:</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"The extraordinary event which happened here yesterday which
still looks more like a dream than a reality namely, the landing in
this harbor of Garibaldi with a band of about 1,500 as fine looking
fellows as you can well imagine, from two Sardinian steamers. The
landing was effected in gallant style, and with most extraordinary
celerity and order, and part of the time under the guns of a Neapolitan
frigate and two steamers. One of the Sardinian vessels was run
aground and scuttled by themselves in the harbor, and the other was
taken outside by the Neapolitans; but after the landing had been
fully effected. I believe the brave adventurers did not lose a man—only
two or three wounded. We were all in a state of alarm during
<a id='Page_300'></a>the firing, as the shot and shell from the frigate went flying about in
a most awkward manner—some into the town, some into Woodhouse's
stores, some into Wood's <i>baglio</i> (factory), and one actually
over our heads here on the <i>baglio</i> terrace, which fell into the
sea beyond the Salinella.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Our Vice-Consul, with the captains of the Intrepid and Argus
(both here fortunately for us at the time), went on board the frigate
during the firing to inquire into the meaning of their missiles, so
capriciously injuring our factories, on each of which the English flag
was flying, and to inculcate more caution and accuracy in their
operations. The Neapolitan commanders, wisely considering that it was
their duty to expend a certain quantity of powder and shot on such
an important occasion, gave the town the benefit of the residuary
dose, after the enemy was snug within the walls, and laughing at this
exhibition of impotent rage. It was, however, no laughing matter
to the poor inhabitants, who, not accustomed to such phenomena, took
to flight in all directions to avoid the effects of the shell, which
did considerable damage about the Porta di Mare and the Grazzia
Vecchia, but fortunately without loss of life, as many families were
in the country for their spring trip. A considerable number, high
and low, flocked under the protection of our flag here, and the old
<i>baglio</i> is as crowded as Noah's Ark, only the animals are all human."</span></p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>MARCH INTO THE INTERIOR.</b></h4>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"In the morning the whole of Garibaldi's party set off for Salemi,
reinforced by a good many Marsalese volunteers, and well provided
with horses for the officers, carts for their spare arms and ammunition,
and mules for the few field-pieces they brought with them. Everything
was managed with admirable order, and apparently to the satisfaction
of General Garibaldi; though under the effect of the bombardment
from the Neapolitan vessels the poor Marsalese did not
show an enthusiastic welcome to their unexpected visitors.</span></p>

<p class='c022'>"<span class='sc'>May 14.</span>—<span class='small'>At Salemi they were received with open arms, after
having been joined on their march by several large armed bands under
Coppola, of the Monte, Baron Sant Anna, of Alcamo, etc. Other two
bands of armed countrymen have set off from this place to join the
brave general, and with the reinforcements expected from Castelvetrano,
Santa Ninfa, and other neighboring towns, they will soon muster
a very formidable force. Even their artillery is increasing, as some
light brass field-pieces, buried since 1849, have been brought out, and
found in good condition. Several Franciscan monks have put
<a id='Page_301'></a>themselves at the head, with the cross in one hand and the sword in the
other."</span></p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>FIRST EFFECTS OF THE ARRIVAL OF GARIBALDI.</b></h4>
<p class='c029'><span class='small'>"The arrival of Garibaldi changed the nature of the insurrection
in Sicily completely. Until then the different <i>squadre</i> (bands) of
<i>picciotti</i> (youngsters) had carried on a kind of desultory guerrilla
warfare without much connection between them. The landowner, if
influential enough, or else some popular man more energetic than the
rest, collected for this purpose whoever wanted to come and had some
sort or other of arms. Their tactics were to appear and disappear in
different parts of the country, and harass from safe places the royal
troops passing through the interior, but as for concerting a plan or
meeting the royalists in the open field, no one would ever have
dreamed of it. The mountainous country, and the want of roads,
greatly facilitated this kind of warfare, while the absence of danger
and fatigue was sufficient inducement even for those who were not
driven there by their hatred against the Neapolitans. The country
between Palermo, Trapani, Marsala, and Corleone was the chief seat
of these <i>squadre</i>, not a few of which were collected at the time
in the mountain chain above Palermo.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi's name and prestige, and the succors which he brought, became
a link between these different squadre, which placed themselves under
his orders. Scarce had the news of his landing spread, when the bands
from Trapani, Corleone, and one or two other places joined. It was to
meet this force, which was every day swelling, that Brigadier-General
Landi was sent in the direction of Marsala and Trapani. The road to
these places is the same as far as Calata Fimi, situated on the top of
an elevated plateau; from thence it separates. A force, therefore,
stationed at the intersection, shuts off all communication by regular
roads from Palermo to Trapani and Marsala. It was on the lower slopes of
the plateau that General Landi had taken his position, with four
battalions, one of them riflemen, and four mountain guns. The road from
Marsala, after passing Salemi, descends one of those long terraced
plateaus which are a characteristic feature of this part of Sicily, and
after crossing a little valley, rises up to the other plateau, where
Calata Fimi is situate. The position was, therefore, one of the most
difficult to carry. Like all soldiers of the same kind, the Neapolitans,
whose muskets are excellent, rely altogether on their fire, especially
if it can be carried on from afar. The reception, therefore, of
Garibaldi and his troops was so hot that the <i>squadre</i> soon sought
shelter where they could, leaving all the work to the troops</span>
<a id='Page_302'></a><span class='small'>Garibaldi had brought with him. The Cacciatori delle Alpi justified
their renown, and in spite of the heat of the day, the advantage of
position and numbers, drove the Neapolitans, at the point of the
bayonet, from one position to another, taking one of the mountain guns.
One of the students from Pavia, a youth certainly not more than
eighteen, was the first to lay hands on it. In less than two hours,
the Neapolitans were driven from all their positions and flying back
toward Palermo. A letter, written by General Landi, was found in the
village. In it he writes to the commander of Palermo to send him
reinforcements, as he could not hold the place. He excuses at the same
time the loss of the gun, by saying that the mule which carried it was
shot—a falsehood, for the gun carriage was taken with it, as well as
the two mules, which are in perfect health.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The retreat of the brigade, which had lost considerably, was not
molested at first, and they passed Alcamo without being attacked, but
at Partenico, where they had sacked, burned, and murdered promiscuously,
throwing women and children into the fire, the people were up and had
occupied the houses, from which they fired on the troops, converting
their flight into a regular rout, the eleventh regiment losing its
colors. Garibaldi is not the man to lose much time, but still the
necessity of concerting a common action with the bands in the
neighborhood of Palermo, prevented him from taking the position of
Monreale by surprise."</span></p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>PALERMO.</b></h4>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"In order to understand the importance of this position, as well
as the rest of the operations, I must say something about the topography
of the basin of Palermo. Long before you arrive at Palermo
by sea, you have before you a bold limestone mountain, standing there
isolated, and resembling somewhat the rock of Gibraltar, but not so
lofty. This rock forms the northern limit of the Bay of Palermo and
of the Conca d'Oro (Gold Shell), the fertile plain in which the town
lies. The plain stretches out in a northwesterly and southeasterly
direction, which is likewise followed in a circular sweep by the
mountain chain.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The plain may be about twelve miles in its greatest length, and from
four to five in its greatest width. Between the isolated Monte Pellegrino
and the rest of the chain the plain runs up to La Favorita, over which a
carriage road goes to Carini; on the opposite side of the plain, skirting
the sea-shore runs the highroad to Messina, passing through Bazaria, and
close to the ruins of Solento. These are the two easiest outlets of the
plain. Everywhere else a continued chain of mountains seems to close
<a id='Page_303'></a>all outlet. Nearest to La Favorita a bad mountain road leads in a
straight line by San Martino to Carini. To the left of this road rises a
rugged, magnificent mountain, looking like the worn side of an extinct
crater; it protrudes somewhat into the plain, and throws out a high spur
in the same direction as the main chain. This spur is Monreale,
and you can see the famous convent and church, as well as the
greatest part of the village. Over this plateau passes the high road
to Trapani. Behind the spur and plateau of Monreale, the mountain forms
a kind of amphitheatre on a colossal scale, the terraced cultivation
helping to keep up the illusion. Where it ends, and the mountain
begins again to protrude into the plain, you can see on the slopes
two white villages; they are Parco and Madonna delle Grazie, over
which a carriage road leads to the Piana del Greci and Corleone, two
old Albanian colonies, established, like a good number in this part of
Sicily by emigration after the death of Skandorbeg. Another spur
runs out into the plain, and forms another amphitheatre, more rugged
and picturesque than that of Monreale, and dominated by the Gebel
Rosso. In the dip a rugged horse-path ascends, called the Passo della
Mezzagna, leading down to the village of Misilmeri, situate on the only
highroad into the interior and to Catania. The Gebel Rosso
toward the sea and Cape Zaffarano, and in the lower depression is the
highroad from Palermo to Catania. It runs almost parallel to the road
on the sea-shore as far as Abate, and then cuts across to the south.
From this description you will see that the Neapolitans, possessing
the command of the sea, had all the advantages of a concentric
position, especially with an enemy who was weak in artillery, and who
was chiefly formidable in the mountains. A general concentration of
their forces in the plain was clearly indicated, with the single
exception of the plateau of Monreale, which is a position in itself, and
commands the road from the interior for some distance. The disadvantage
of him who attacked was considerably increased by the difficult
nature of the mountains, which makes all lateral communication
between the roads almost impossible, so that any change of the attack
implied a great circuit. The Neapolitans, who had studied the thing
for years, were fully aware of these advantages, and concentrated
their forces in the plain, merely occupying the plateau of Monreale.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi could not unite his forces in time to arrive at Monreale
before the Neapolitans had occupied it in great force, and when he
arrived in the neighborhood of the position, four days after the victory
of Calata Fimi, he saw that the taking of Monreale could only be
effected with great loss. He therefore determined to change his
plans. The first thing was to surround and watch all the outlets, and
<a id='Page_304'></a>for this purpose the different <i>squadri</i> of the insurgents took up
positions all round the chain of mountains which inclose the bay. It was
one of the finest sights you could see when their fires blazed up at
night, and mingled their red glare with the pale light of the moon.
They were watched by the inhabitants like the holy fire by the Parsee,
and the sole occupation during the last eight days or so seemed to be
to observe and comment on their meaning. Now they seemed stronger
on one peak, now more spread and continuous on the slope of another
mountain, and on the hope kindled by these fires the uninitiated
lived. Palermo was in a state of excitement and ferment impossible
to describe, and strong enough to brave the state of siege which had
been proclaimed. The Secret Committee, which had maintained itself
in spite of the vigilance and suspicion of the police, always found
means to communicate with Garibaldi, in spite of the military
authorities. The committee was known to exist, and it circulated printed
bulletins almost daily, but it was so organized that the police,
although aware of its existence, could never discover the members. It
was a kind of freemasonry, with different degrees of initiation. No one
not a member knew more than one member. The houses where the meetings
were held were continually changed, and all obeyed blindly.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The committee informed Garibaldi that Palermo was ready to
rise, but it imposed the condition that he should appear before the
gates of the town. He accepted this condition, and made his plans
accordingly. Seeing that he had come too late for Monreale, he left
a party of the native insurgents to keep up the fires and engage the
Neapolitans, while he took off the mass of the force, and, by an
almost incredible march along the mountain chain, where the guns
had to be carried by the men, he appeared all at once at Parco, on
the road to Piana, on the 23d. As soon as the Neapolitans saw their
mistake, they sent up in hot haste toward Parco whatever they could
muster of forces without exposing their position in the town. They
did not think them sufficient; for, after some skirmishing on that day,
they withdrew again to their position on two lower plateaus, the
Piana Borazzo and Santa Theresa. The next day, 24th, they got up
some of the troops from Monreale, and thus strengthened, made another
attack—the same I witnessed from on board ship. The purpose
was gained; they had got another change. Garibaldi withdrew,
leaving just a few of the bands behind. These latter did not wait
long to follow, and the 'Regii,' as the soldiers are called, entered
both Madonna delle Grazie and Parco the same afternoon, and pillaged
and burned the place, according to time-honored custom, killing
<a id='Page_305'></a>a number of the peaceful inhabitants, and publishing as usual next day,
a splendid bulletin, announcing the defeat of the bands of Garibaldi,
and promising their speedy subjection. Although Neapolitan
bulletins are not much believed, yet there were many in the town
whose hearts sank when they saw Garibaldi retire a second time.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"They little knew the man with whom they had to do, nor did the
Neapolitans either—although they ought to have remembered Velletri.
It was <i>reculer pour mieux sauter</i>. In order the better to deceive the
Neapolitans, he went back to Piana, and sent his artillery even farther
back, while he himself, with his chosen band, made his way over the
mountains again, and, while the Neapolitans followed his track to
Piana, he had arrived yesterday morning at Misilmeri, on the highroad
to Catania, where he had given rendezvous to all the chieftains
or captains on that side of the mountain chain.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"I was sick of uncertain rumors, which alone were to be got at in town,
and which would leave your readers in darkness about the true state of
things. Besides knowing a little of the gallant general's tactics, I
had a strong suspicion that something was impending which could be
better seen from without than from inside the town, so I determined to
see whether I could not get there. Some English and American officers
had been out in that direction, and had seen one of the captains, a
popular man of this place, called La Maza, so I determined likewise to
have a trial. Some friends in the town indicated the way, and I set off
in the carriage of one of them. The road to Messina, starting from the
Marina and the Villa Giulia at the end of it, skirts the sea as far as
Abate, where it unites with the highroad to Misilmeri and Catania. I was
advised to take this last, as the least infested by soldiers. What with
their confidence in their navy, and what with the stratagem of
Garibaldi, the Neapolitans had paid little attention to this road and
the southeasterly side in general. Two sentries before the corner of the
Villa Giulia, and a post of a score of men a little further, in the
<i>octroi</i> building, were all that were in the neighborhood of the
town. Straggling houses continue for some distance up to a bridge
leading over a little stream or torrent called Orveto, which flows into
the sea about a quarter of a mile further on. All along these houses
there is a chain of sentries, and in the vicinity of the bridge a post
of perhaps eighty men who furnish these sentries.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"I passed them without an inquiry, and was free. There had been
the Neapolitan steamers cruising about every day all along this coast;
no necessity was therefore felt for any further precaution. I rolled
along fast enough with my two Calabrese horses, and passed some
American officers, probably bound for Solento. At the very gates of
<a id='Page_306'></a>the town the people had joined the insurrection, but there was a kind
of neutral ground between the two, which ended in a village beyond
Abate, the name of which I cannot recollect. If the Regii were careless,
the insurgents were not, and at the entrance of the village one
of their armed men asked me for permission to be my guide, a thing
which exactly suited me. As we drove through the village the people
rushed forward, and trying to kiss my hands, asked me for arms.
They were all ready to join, but had no arms, which did not prevent
their raising shouts for Italy, Victor Emanuel, and Garibaldi. We
had to gallop off in order not to be stopped at every step. A drive
of half an hour or more in a gentle descent, with a lovely valley
beneath, and beautiful mountain scenery in front, brought me to the
town of Misilmeri, a wretched little place, altogether wanting in
character. In the little square held out on one side the committee,
which forms a kind of provisional government, and on the other, up
some wooden steps fixed outside, was enthroned the chief of the staff
of Garibaldi's expedition in primitive simplicity. Colonel Sirtori was
just giving a pass to two young American officers from the United
State's steamship Iroquois, without which no one was allowed to enter
the camp. As he had likewise given them an officer as guide, I
joined them, and up we sauntered toward the heights leading to the
Gebel Rosso and the pass the Mezzagna. We had soon left behind
us the few remaining houses, and the ruins of the feudal castle to the
left, the white limestone walls of which had something in them which
reminded you of a skeleton. The ground all about is planted with
olive-trees, vines, and different sorts of grain, which all grow
luxuriantly in spite of the stony nature of the place. The general had
pitched his camp on a tolerably extensive plateau just above the
ruins, looking down on one side toward the plain and the range
which ends at Cape Zaffarana, while on the other the peaks of the
Gebel Rosso and the pass of Mezzagna were visible across a depression
in the ground, looking very much like an extinct crater, and
now partially filled with water, owing to the copious rains which had
fallen during the last few days. It was one of those panoramas which
suggest naturally your pitching your tent there—that is, if you have
one. The word tent is erased from the military dictionary of Garibaldi.
However, a popular general has to yield at times to his
soldiers, and so he could not prevent them from sticking into the
ground four of the lances with which the squadron, who have no muskets,
are armed, and from throwing over them a blanket. Under the
tent you could see the guacha saddle arranged as a pillow, and the
black sheepskin covering as a bed. As for every one else, there were
<a id='Page_307'></a>the olive-trees affording shade, plenty of stones for pillows, and
perhaps for every tenth man a cloak or blanket. All around were
picketed the horses, most of them entire, and behaving accordingly.
The general himself was not there when we arrived; he had taken one of
his morning strolls, but in front of his tent there were all his trusty
followers—Colonel Turr, the Hungarian, although still suffering from
the shot in his arm, received in last year's campaign, yet always ready
where there is danger; Colonel Bixio, another trusty follower and
well-known officer of the Cacciatori delle Alpi; Colonel Carini, the
bravest of Sicilians, likewise an officer of that corps, besides a
number of others, all brave like him, among them Garibaldi's young son,
with a shot wound in his wrist, received at Calata Fimi, and the son of
Daniel Manin, wounded in the thigh. There was the ex-priest Guzmaroli, a
Romagnole, who has vowed the most enthusiastic worship to his hero,
and follows him like his shadow, providing for his comforts,
and watching his person in the moment of danger. There was
a small cluster of guides, most of them of good Lombard families,
meant to serve on horseback, but now on foot, and the foremost in
the battle. Not the least remarkable among all these figures was the
Sicilian monk, Frate Pantaleone—jolly, like the picture of a monk of
the middle ages, but full of fire and patriotism, and as brave as any
of the others. He had joined the force at Salemi, and did his best
to encourage and comfort them. Several among the leading men
from Palermo and its vicinity were likewise present among them,
with several priests and monks, who are among the most sincere and
energetic promoters of the movement. They were a strange sight,
indeed, in this by no means very Catholic army; but I assure you
their behavior has been such that the wildest among these youths
honor and respect them, and in them their order.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Well, all this motley crowd, increased now by the two young
American naval men, and soon after joined by three British naval
officers, was collected around a common nucleus—a smoking kettle,
with the larger part of a calf in it, and a liberal allowance of onions,
a basket with heaps of fresh bread, and a barrel containing Marsala.
Every one helped himself in the most communistic manner, using
fingers and knife, and drinking out of the solitary tin pot. It is only
in this irregular warfare that you see these scenes in their greatest
perfection. The long marches and countermarches, rains, fights,
and sleeping on the ground, had made almost every one worthy to
figure in a picture by Murillo, with all those grand Sicilian mountains,
not unlike those of Greece, forming a background such as no
picture can reproduce."</span></p>

</div>
<h4 class='c014'><a id='Page_308'></a><b>GARIBALDI IN COUNCIL.</b></h4>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"Soon after my arrival, Garibaldi made his appearance, and received
his foreign visitors with that charming, quiet simplicity which
characterizes him, lending himself with great complaisance to the
invariably recurring demands of autographs, and answering the numerous
questions which were naturally put to him. It was only after the
departure of his guests that the general resumed business. The question
debated was nothing more nor less than to venture on a <i>coup de main</i>
on Palermo the same night. There was no doubt, all the information
went to show, that the Neapolitans had taken the bait
thrown out for them—that they had taken a feigned retreat for a
defeat, and the sending back of the guns toward the interior as a
sign of discouragement. As to the flank movement to Misilmeri,
they seemed to have no idea of it, for men come from Piani stated
that they were in force in that place. Another considerable body of
men was at Parco, and on the road beyond it. In Monreale, the
reports spoke likewise of several thousand. In fact, the approaches
to these two last-named places, called the Piana di Borazzo and the
Theresa, both of which are close to the Palazzo Reale, in the southwest
part of the town, were the points of concentration, while the
outlets from the southerly and the southeasterly parts of the town
were comparatively undefended. Former events had forced the
Neapolitans to pay attention to the topography of the town, so as to
remain masters of it in case of a popular rising. This was not very
easy in such a town as Palermo, which, like a true southern town,
forms a labyrinth of small and tortuous streets, flanked by high
houses all provided with balconies. This was a serious drawback for
the troops in a street fight. The Neapolitans did their best to repair
the disadvantage. There are two streets, evidently of Spanish origin,
which form the main arteries of the town. The first, called Via di
Toledo, starting from the Marina at Porta Felice, traverses the town
in a straight line from northeast to southwest, passing close to the
Cathedral of Santa Rosalia, and ending at the Piazza Reale, the largest
square of Palermo, on the opposite side of the town from which
the roads start to Monreale and Parco. Besides the royal palace,
supposed to be on the site of the old palace of the Emirs of Sicily,
there are several large public buildings which line the square, the
Archivescovado forming one corner, and the large convent of St.
Elizabetha the other. The ground rises gently toward this part,
which commands the whole town. At right angles to the Via di
Toledo runs another street equally straight, the Strada Moquerada,
<a id='Page_309'></a>which, starting from the Porto San Antonino, and traversing the
whole town, leads out the road to La Favorita and to the Mole. The
two intersect each other right in the centre of the town, where the
octagonal place is called the Piazzi Bologni. The lower half of the
town, from the sea to this place, had been almost abandoned, or
rather committed to the tender care of the shipping and the Castello,
which occupies a projecting height on the seashore, near the
northeasterly corner of the town. A few posts at the gates of the town
on this side, rather points of observation than of action, and a company
or so in the building of the Finanze, situated in this part of the
town, were all that remained of troops on that side.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"In order to establish and keep up the communication between the
upper half of the town, the real point of defence, and the sea-shore,
two large <i>stradoni</i> have been opened outside of the town, both of
them starting from the neighborhood of the royal palace, and running
down to the sea, near to the Villa Giulia, a large public garden
adjoining the Marina, and the other passing through the Quartiere
dei Quatri Venti, to the Mole. This latter <i>stradone</i> has always been
considered as the line of retreat to the place of embarkation, and is
flanked by large buildings, the political prison, some barracks, the
criminal prison, and finally the works on the Mole itself.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The plan which Garibaldi conceived from these dispositions,
was to surprise the posts in the lower and comparatively ill-defended
part of the town, to throw himself into the town, and
then gradually work his way from street to street. The two
roads leading to this part of the town run almost parallel, and
not far from each other. That close to the sea-shore was the least
guarded, containing merely a company or so, altogether cut off
from all communication. The task would have been easier from this
side, had it not been for the fear of the march of a long column
being discovered, and thus an alarm given. The second, the highroad
from the interior, was therefore chosen as the line of operations.
It crosses, about half a mile from the town, the route Del Ammiraglio,
leads through a large open street to the <i>stradone</i> on this side
of the town, and enters the town at the Porta di Termini. At this
gate the Neapolitans had made a sandbag barricade, which was occupied
by two companies. The <i>stradone</i> before it was enfiladed by a
couple of mountain guns, placed at the gate of Sant' Antonino.
Beyond the <i>stradone</i> small forts extended all along the road up to the
bridge, and the outposts were just on the other side of the bridge.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"With that just <i>coup d'œil</i> which Garibaldi certainly possesses,
he had singled out this point as the most practicable. Having, with the
<a id='Page_310'></a>exception of the troops he had brought with him, but rough,
undisciplined guerrillas at his disposal, he saw that the best chance
was to concentrate all his forces, and surprise or break through by
main force. The operation was to be assisted by a general rise of the
people in the town.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Having sketched out his plan, he convoked the different guerrilla
chiefs and informed them of his intention. He told them that it was
not his custom to have councils of war, but he thought it for once
good to consult them, as upon the resolution taken must depend the
fate of Sicily, and perhaps of Italy. There were only two things to
be done—either to try and get possession of Palermo by a <i>coup de
main</i>, or else to withdraw and begin a regular organization in the
interior, and form an army. He, for his part, was for a <i>coup de main</i>,
which would at once settle the fate of the island. He told them to
be brief in their remarks, and not deliberate long. Most were utterly
astonished at the boldness of this plan, and some made remarks
about the want of ammunition for their men. They were told for
the hundredth time, that it was not long shots which imposed on the
well-armed Neapolitans, but a determined rush in advance—that they
ought not to waste their ammunition and fire off their guns for sport,
and were promised whatever could be spared. This objection being
waived, all expressed more or less loudly their approbation of the
plan, and were dismissed with the injunction to animate their people
and keep up their courage."</span></p>

<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>PREPARATIONS TO ATTACK PALERMO—NIGHT MARCH—ATTACK—BATTLE—THE
BOMBARDMENT.</span></b></p>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"The first idea was to make the attack in the middle of the night—the
Neapolitans don't like to stir at night, and there was every
chance of a panic among them; but there was some danger that way
likewise for the Sicilian insurgents, and it was thought best to make
such arrangements as would bring the force at dawn to the gates of
the town. According to the original and better plan of the general
himself and his adjutant-general, Colonel Turr, the movement was to
have been made along the main road from Misilmeri, broad enough
to admit of considerable development of the columns, and commodious
in every respect. The native captains, however, suggested the
Pass of Mezzagna, which descends from the heights behind Gebel Rosso
into the plain of Palermo. According to their statements, it
was much shorter and by no means difficult. Their statements were
believed, and the whole force received orders to be concentrated by
nightfall on the summit of the pass, crowned with a church.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"According to the first disposition, the troops brought by the
general himself were to lead the way, and the <i>squadre</i> to follow; but
some of the chiefs begged it as a favor for their corps to have the
honor of being first in the town—a claim which could not be very
well refused. The plan was, therefore, modified. The guides and
three men from each company of the Cacciatori delle Alpi, were
formed into an <i>avant-garde</i>, confided to Major Tüköri, a Hungarian,
an officer who distinguished himself under General Kméty on the 29th of
September, at Kars. Behind this <i>avant-garde</i> followed the Sicilians,
commanded by La Maga, an emigrant, who had come over with
Garibaldi. The second line was led by the riflemen of Genoa—excellent
shots, all armed with the Swiss carbine. Behind them came the
two battalions of Cacciatori delle Alpi, and in the rear the rest of the
Sicilians.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><a id='Page_312'></a><span class='small'>"The order having been distributed, the different bands gradually
worked their way toward the summit of the pass. The packing up
at headquarters did not take much time; it soon after broke up its
camp and followed the troops. I was mounted on a regular Rosinante,
with a halter passed round the jaw, and provided with a saddle
which seemed to have been formed to fit on the vertebræ of my lean
black charger. A blanket was, however, found in due time, and on
the whole I cannot complain. The road up to the pass winds along
rows of gigantic cactus hedges, which give a thoroughly eastern
character to the country. It was just sunset when we arrived on the
top, where, through a gap, we could see the bay and town of Palermo
and the sea beyond, looking more like a fairy picture than reality.
All the mountains, with their rugged points naturally of a reddish
tint, seemed to have drunk in the rays of the setting sun, and exhibited
that rosy color which I had thought hitherto a special gift of
the plain of Attica. While you had this charming scene before you,
you looked behind, as it were, into the hearts of the mountains. It
was one of the finest spots I ever saw, and all the country was fragrant
with spring flowers, the perfume of which came out with
redoubled vigor as soon as the sun had set. It proved a bad road
for the expedition, that mountain pass, but it was lovely to look
upon.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"In order to entertain the Neapolitans with the idea that all was
safe on that side, the usual large fires were kindled on the tops of the
mountains, and kept up long after our departure by men left behind
for that purpose. Garibaldi went up to look at the position underneath,
or, perhaps, to indulge in that kind of reverie to which he is
subject in such solemn moments, and which ends in a concentration
of all his faculties on the sole aim he has before him.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The evening gun in the fort had been long reëchoed by the mountains,
and the moon had risen clear and bright above our heads, giving
a new charm to this lovely scenery, before we stirred."</span></p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE NIGHT MARCH.</b></h4>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"During this interval the <i>picciotti</i> (youngsters), as the patriots
are called, were put into some kind of order, which, you will believe
me, was no easy matter in the comparative darkness which prevailed; no
chief knowing his men, and the men not recognizing their chief—every
one acting for some one else, and no one able to give an
answer. With the exception of the troops brought over by Garibaldi,
all the rest seemed an entangled mass almost impossible to unravel.
<a id='Page_313'></a>However, by degrees, those belonging to the same chief found themselves
together, and the march began about ten, <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Either the
Sicilian chieftains had never looked at the Pass of Mezzagna, or else
they have curious ideas of a road; the whole is nothing but a track
among big stones, crossing and recrossing the bed of a mountain torrent,
following not unfrequently the bed of the torrent, leading over
smooth masses of stones and across most awkward gaps—all this at
an angle of twenty-five degrees, to be passed on horseback at night!
Even the men could only go singly, which made our line a frightful
length, and caused continual delays and stoppages. The general
vowed never to believe another Sicilian report on the state of a
mountain road. However, in the end, we reached the plain and came in
among the olive-trees below, with few falls among the sure-footed
horses. A halt was made until all the columns had descended, and
during this halt an incident occurred which did not promise much for
the future behavior of our <i>picciotti</i>. The horses in Sicily are left
for the most part entire, hence continual fighting and considerable
neighing, which was so inconvenient in a night expedition of this
kind that several of the most vicious steeds had to be sent back. One
of them still remained, and began its antics; the rider lost patience,
which made matters worse. Those nearest threw themselves back in
haste, and communicated the movement to those behind. These,
many of whom had sat down and began to doze, mistook in their
dreams, probably, the trees for Neapolitans, the stars for so many
shells, and the moon for a colossal fireball; at any rate, the majority
of them were, with one bound, in the thickets on both sides of the
road, several fired off their muskets in their fright, and very little
was wanting to cause a general panic. Every one did what he could
to restore confidence, but the effect was produced and reacted, as you
will see by and by. Another incident occurred, which might have
led to the failure of the whole expedition. The Sicilian guides who
were with the <i>avant-garde</i> missed the road, and instead of taking a
by-road which led into the main road we had to pursue, they continued
on the road near the hill-side, which would have brought us
just where the Neapolitans were in the greatest strength. The mistake
was perceived in time and repaired, but not without considerable
loss of time. At last the column emerged on to the main road,
which is broad and skirted by high garden walls. As we had lost
considerable time with all these <i>contretemps</i>, and as dawn was
approaching, we had to make haste, but whether from fatigue or the
impression of the night panic, the <i>picciotti</i> could not be brought to
move very fast. It was just the first glimmer of dawn when we
<a id='Page_314'></a>passed the first houses, which extend in this direction a long way out
of the town of Palermo. The <i>squadre</i>, who ought to have known the
locality better, began shouting and 'evvivaing,' just as if we had been
close to the gates. Had it not been for this blunder, the <i>avant-garde</i>
might have surprised the post on the bridge of the Ammiragliato,
and probably penetrated into the town without the loss of a man.
As it was, the shouting not only roused those on guard on the bridge,
but likewise gave an opportunity to the Neapolitans to strengthen
the force at the gate of Termini, and to make all their dispositions
for a defence from the flank.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Instead, therefore, of surprising the post on the bridge, the
<i>avant-garde</i> was received by a well-sustained fire, not only in front,
but from the houses in their flanks. At the first sound of the musketry,
most of the <i>picciotti</i> were across the garden walls, but not
with the view of firing from behind them, leaving thus the 30 or 40
men of the <i>avant-garde</i> all isolated in the large exposed street which
leads to the bridge. The first battalion of the Cacciatori was sent
up, and as it did not carry the position fast enough, the second was
sent after it soon after. While these were driving back the Neapolitans,
every one did his best to drive the <i>picciotti</i> forward. It was
not so easy, in the beginning especially, when the sound of cannon
was heard in front, although its effects were scarcely visible. However,
the <i>picciotti</i>, who remind me very much of Arnout Bashibazouks,
can be led on after the first unpleasant sensation has passed
away, especially when they see that it is not all shots that kill or
wound—not even the cannon-shots, which make so formidable a
noise. They could see this to perfection this morning, for although
the Neapolitan rifles are scarcely inferior to the best fire-arms, I
never saw so little damage done by so much shooting. Every one
put himself, therefore, to work to lead and urge on the <i>picciotti</i>,
driving them out of the sheltered places by all kinds of contrivances,
and often by blows and main force. After some trouble, most of
them were safely brought through the open space before the bridge,
but the general tendency was to go under rather than above the
bridge, which is, like all bridges over torrents, high, and was, in this
instance, exposed to a heavy cross fire from the Piana di Borazzo,
where the Neapolitans had a loopholed wall and some guns mounted,
which threw a few ill-aimed shells. While the general himself, and
many of his staff, did their best to make them leave this shelter
again and proceed, the <i>avant-garde</i> had chased back the Neapolitans
to the <i>stradone</i> which runs down to the sea just in front of the
Porta di Termini. The Neapolitan fort at the gate, considerably
<a id='Page_315'></a>reinforced, opened a hot fire, which swept down the long avenue of
houses leading to the bridge, while at the same time the two guns
and the troops posted at the Porta Sant' Antonino, brought a cross
fire to bear on the attackers. But this was no obstacle to the brave
fellows who led the way. They did not lose time with firing, but
rushed on with the bayonet. The commander of the <i>avant-garde</i>,
who was a Hungarian major, and three of the guides, were the first
across the sand-bag barricade in the town, but the leader was
wounded by a shot which shattered his left knee. Otherwise the
loss had been trifling. While the <i>avant-garde</i> and the Cacciatori
chased the Neapolitans from spot to spot, the Palermitans began
likewise to stir, but, justice compels me to say, only in the parts
which the troops had left.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The same scene as at the bridge was repeated at the crossing of the
<i>stradone</i> by the <i>picciotti</i>, who followed in a straggling movement.
And yet it was important to get into the town, in order not to be
outflanked or taken in the rear by the Neapolitans holding the Piana
di Borazzo. In order to avert this danger, the order was given to
some of the bands to get behind the garden walls which line the
road by which the Neapolitans might have come down on our left.
These diversions, and probably the dislike to fight in open field,
were sufficient to parry this danger until the greatest part of the
stragglers had passed. At the same time a barricade was thrown up in
the rear with anything which could be laid hold of. This work pleased
the <i>picciotti</i> so well, that they began throwing up a barricade in
front likewise. At any rate, they blocked up a part of the road before
they could be prevented.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"But the most critical thing was decidedly the crossing of the
<i>stradone</i>, where the cross fire was kept up, and all kinds of dodges
were resorted to to make them risk this <i>salto</i>, which they thought
mortal. I and one of the followers of Garibaldi held out one of the
men by main force exposed to the fire, which soon made him run
across. It was here, above all, that the bad firing of the Neapolitans
told. I was looking on for some time, and did not see a single
man even wounded. In order to encourage the <i>picciotti</i>, one of the
Genoese riflemen took four or five chairs, planted the tricolor on one
of them, and sat down upon it for some time. The thing took at
last decidedly, and you saw the <i>picciotti</i> stopping on the road to
fire off their muskets.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Close to the Porta di Termini is the Vecchia Fiera—the old
market-place. One must know these Sicilians to have an idea of the
<a id='Page_316'></a>frenzy, screaming, shouting, crying, and hugging: all would kiss
Garibaldi's hand and embrace his knees. Every moment brought new
masses, which debouched in troops from one of the streets, anxious to
have their turn. As the Cacciatori gradually cleared the lower part
of the town, most of the inhabitants came to have a look, and give a
greeting to the Liberator of Palermo and Sicily. The entrance was
effected about half-past 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and by noon more than one-half
of the town was clear of the troops. But two hours before this was
effected, the citadel had opened its fire on the town, at first
moderately enough, but soon after with great vigor, firing large 13-inch
shell, red-hot shot, and every other projectile calculated to do the
greatest possible damage. About noon or so, the ships in the harbor
opened their fire, and between the two they contrived to destroy
a great number of houses in the lower part of the town, killing and
wounding a great number of people of all ages and both sexes. Two
of the large shells were sent right into the hospital, and exploded in
one of the wards. Everywhere you perceived ruins and conflagrations,
dead and wounded, not a few of whom must have perished among
the ruins of their houses. It was especially the part of the town
near the Piazzi Bologni, and some of the adjoining streets which was
ill-treated. If the object of the Neapolitans was to inspire terror,
they certainly succeeded. Whoever could, took refuge in whatever
he thought the most bomb-proof place, and those who could not, you
saw crying, praying, and wringing their hands in the streets. It was
a pitiable sight, indeed, and it did more harm to inoffensive people
than to those who might have retaliated. Before opening the fire,
the commodore sent a polite message to all the men-of-war which
were in the way to get out of it, and all the vessels which were
moored inside the Mole had to shift their berths and take up positions
outside."</span></p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE BOMBARDMENT.</b></h4>

<div class='c030'>"<span class='sc'>Evening.</span></div>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The bombardment is still kept up, with only short intervals,
especially from the Castle, where the <i>alter ego</i> of King Bomba II.
reigns. There is no doubt that Admiral Mundy made very strong
representations to the Neapolitan commodore about the bombardment,
but they have not been listened to. Some parts of the town
will have to be entirely rebuilt, the large shells having passed right
through from top to bottom, shaking those ill-built constructions.
Several of the churches have come in for their share; yet all this
<a id='Page_317'></a>useless bombardment has not prevented the soldiers from being, by
degrees dislodged from all their positions in the town, with the
exception of the parts about the royal palace and their line of
communication with the Mole. In the lower part of the town they possess
only the Castello Amare and the Finanze, which is held by a company
or so of soldiers. Most of the foreign subjects have taken refuge
on board the men-of-war, and all the consuls, with the exception
of Mr. Goodwin, our own, who sticks like a true Briton to his
consular flag. According to all accounts, there is no comparison,
between the bombardment in 1848 and the present one. Then the
Neapolitans were satisfied with sending one or two shells every half
hour, while now they take just time enough to let their guns and
mortars cool.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"All those who came in this morning with Garibaldi are dead
beat, having had no sleep last night, and plenty of work since. The
general himself is reposing on the platform which surrounds the large
fountain in the Piazza del Pretorio, where the committee is sitting
<i>en permanence</i>. This committee, the same which carried on the
whole movement from the beginning, has constituted itself as a
provisional government, under the dictatorship of Garibaldi. It has
appointed several special committees for the different branches of its
operations, and provides as well as possible for the many wants which
occur every moment. Considering the oppression under which the
people have been, very little preparation could be made for the
emergency, and everything has to be provided now under the pressure
of the moment—arms, as far as possible, ammunition, provisions
for the troops, hospital wants and arrangements, besides the great
fact of satisfying every one who wants, or thinks he wants, something,
and listening to every one who has something to say, or thinks
he has. There is a great deal of good-will on the part of the committee,
but I must say it is not so energetically seconded by the
Palermitans as one could have expected from their enthusiasm.
There is a semi-oriental <i>laissez aller</i> about them, which only
produces fits of activity scarcely equal to the moment.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"At our first entrance into the town, there was a good deal of
haste made about the barricades, but as the extension of the occupation
constantly requires new barricades, there is some difficulty in keeping
them up to the work; a great many <i>evvivas</i>, but all preferred
to run about the streets to laying hand to the work. Even
the ringing of the bells, the most demoralizing sound to an army
in a populous town, can, in spite of all injunctions, be only kept
<a id='Page_318'></a>up in fits and starts. It is the southern indolence, which soon
gets the better of all good dispositions.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The town is illuminated, and presents, during the intervals of
the bombardment, an animated appearance; but all the shops are
still closed. The illumination, with the antique-shaped glass lamps
suspended from the balconies, presents a very pretty effect, rather
heightened by the shells flying through the clear sky."</span></p>

IN PALERMO—GARIBALDI'S DECREE FOR POOR SOLDIERS AND
THEIR FAMILIES.</span></b></p>
<p class='c012'>"<span class='sc'>The</span> <span class='small'>taking of Palermo has had decidedly its effect on the
country around. There is no end of the <i>squadre</i> which are approaching
in all directions and hovering about the Regii. As soon as these latter
had left Monreale, the insurgents in the neighborhood descended to
occupy it as well as San Martino. All about Piana and Corleone they
are swarming and skirmishing, so that the column of 1,500 or 1,600
men which has been sent in that direction is rather compromised.
They hoped to destroy Garibaldi and his partisans, and the fate they
prepared for them may await themselves.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"But while thus the general march of events is decidedly favorable,
I must say the Palermitans are scarcely up to the mark. They are
all well-intentioned, but they are distressingly indolent, and want that
general coöperation which is most calculated to insure success. There
is no initiative or activity on their part, and their sole occupation
seems to be to invent and spread rumors. Not a quarter of an
hour passes without some fellow or other coming in out of breath and
announcing the advance of the royal troops; now they are from one,
now from the other side. Above all, horses and cavalry seem to be
the nightmare of the Palermitans. They see the solitary regiment
of Neapolitan cavalry everywhere. It is in vain that their noses are
thrust against the barricades with which the whole town is blocked
up, they <i>will</i> see the cavalry. But, although they are thus haunted
by the royal troops, few seem to think that they ought to do some
thing for themselves—making preparations for the defence of their
<a id='Page_320'></a>houses and streets, and being always ready to meet an attack. It
never occurs to them, as it did to the Lombards last year, that it is
their duty to think day and night how to alleviate the sufferings of
those who bleed in their cause. It is not the want of will, but a
deficiency in acting otherwise than by order. The only thing which
they do spontaneously, is to cry "Evviva," and promenade the
streets, eager for news and gossip.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The irregulars are decidedly improving. They are getting a taste for
barricade and street fighting; they still blaze away their ammunition
in a frantic manner, but they are beginning to keep to their
posts and even to advance, if not too much exposed. This is our
advantage in these street fights; the longer they last, the more they
increase the confidence of the irregulars, and destroy the discipline
of the regular troops.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Every hour brings new proofs of this in the shape of prisoners and
deserters from the Neapolitan forces. With those taken in the
hospitals, there must be above 1,000. There is an order from the
general to treat them well, and there is no animosity prevailing
against them, but so much the greater is that against the <i>sbirri</i> and
'<i>compagni d'armi</i>,' a kind of local police, who have committed great
horrors. They are picked out everywhere, and brought up in gangs
of five and six to the committee, trembling for their lives; but only
one of them has been killed hitherto, having been taken in the act of
firing at those who wanted to arrest him.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The ceasing of the bombardment, or rather the diminishing of it,
has brought people out into the streets again."</span></p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>GARIBALDI IN A DANGEROUS CRISIS.</b></h4>
<div class='c024'>"<i>May 29</i>—6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span></div>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"About 3 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> one of those panics suddenly broke out again
which occur every moment, and serve more than anything else to
demoralize the town and the <i>squadre</i>. The steamers which had gone
off yesterday came back, and the rumor was that they were disembarking
their troops before the Porta dei Greci;—great running and
movement, great confusion, all caused by a column of dust on the
road running along the sea-shore. In the afternoon there was some
heavy firing, both toward the Piazza Reale and on the left of it,
where the Neapolitans have a bastion which flanks the palace and is
itself defended from the Castello. All yesterday and to-day the
object on that side was to get possession of a cluster of houses, so as
to isolate that bastion, and force them out of this, as from that of
<a id='Page_321'></a>Sant' Agata. The town is too large, and Garibaldi's immediate followers
are too few to be sent everywhere, and too precious to be exposed,
except in the greatest necessity. Thus it is the <i>squadre</i> who
form the mass in most places.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The Archbishop of Palermo, and many heads of religious orders,
paid a visit to Garibaldi, and returned, delighted with the simplicity
and modesty of his bearing. Garibaldi finds himself more at home
with the Sicilian clergy than with any other, because it has never
made common cause with tyranny, or lost the manly virtues of the
citizen. 'It was worth while to come to Sicily,' he said, 'if only to
find out that there is still an Italian clergy.' Garibaldi, on the other
hand, must contrast favorably in their eyes with the Neapolitan
generals who have profaned their churches and plundered them of
their sacred vessels, as General Clary did at the sack of Catania, in
the confident expectation that the Pope would absolve him as he
absolved the Swiss, who, in sacking Perugia, laid ecclesiastical as well
as lay property under contribution."</span></p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>ADDRESS OF THE PALERMO CORPORATION TO GARIBALDI.</b></h4>
<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"A deputation of the municipality of Palermo presented an address
to Garibaldi, expressing its thanks to the liberator of Sicily. The
address contains the resolution that the Porta Termini, by which the
forces of Garibaldi entered, is to be called henceforth Porta Garibaldi,
and the Piazza Vecchia the Piazza di Vittorio Emmanuell. A statue has
been likewise decreed to Garibaldi. It is to be erected by subscription.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi answered the deputation by one of those heart-stirring
speeches that he knows how to make, reminding them that all was
not done, and that every effort must be concentrated to complete the
work. He gave them good advice about their duty to organize the
people; that there was but one choice between the Neapolitans and
a general armament; that Sicily could only be free as part of Italy.
He told them that they ought to work for this, but that the time for
annexation had not come. It would lead to foreign interference,
which ought to be avoided. When the time came, he would be the
first to lead in this matter, to which he had devoted his life.
Cheering and an enthusiastic expression of thorough confidence was
the answer."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>Thus it was that Garibaldi, after a brief career, marked
by wonderful success at every step, entered Palermo by the
<a id='Page_322'></a>eastern gates, and between daybreak and ten o'clock in the
morning, had possession of the greater part of the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Neapolitans were driven into a number of strong positions
round the royal palace, to the southwest of the town,
and to the northwest toward the Mole, their line of retreat,
and, not being able to do anything more, the ships opened
their fire, always the last remedy. Almost all the civilized
nations had representatives of their fleets on the spot to
witness and approve by their presence this noble proceeding—English,
French, American, Sardinian, Austrian—none of
them were wanting; nay, they anchored in a way which
might not hinder the movements of the brave Neapolitan
fleet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young King of Naples, though only twenty-three
years old, has shown so much of the spirit of his father,
recently deceased, that he has been justly named Bomba
Junior, or the young Bomb-shell. When the landing of
Garibaldi produced the first fit of terror at Naples, the
youthful Bourbon sent to his brave fleet concentrated in the
Bay of Palermo the order to bombard his faithful Palermitans,
and reduce their town to ashes if they should dare to rise
against his paternal authority. The Palermitans had been
treated once already in this paternal manner by the illustrious
father of the present sovereign, who figures in history as
King Bomba, for having given these souvenirs of his love to
every large town of his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the latter part of the fighting between Garibaldi's
troops and those of the king, when the latter were nearly
driven from the streets of Palermo, the ammunition of the
<i>picciotti</i> (or little boys, as the patriot recruits were called)
was exhausted at that point, one party of them fell back in
one of the streets, and thus allowed the royalists to shut in a
street of houses in which another party of them was still
holding out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi was at dinner when the news arrived. There
had been so many rumors of an advance of the Neapolitans
<a id='Page_323'></a>during the day, that the first impression was that this was
merely another of those wild rumors; but Captain Niva, who
brought it, was one of the Garibaldians, and there could be
no doubt about its truth. Garibaldi jumped up from his
chair, saying, "Well, then, I suppose I must go there
myself." He saw it was one of those moments when the
chief must be at the head of his troops to restore their confidence.
He went downstairs, and took with him whatever
troops he found on the road to that exposed point, and proceeded
to retake the lost ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>"His presence (wrote a person who was in the city at
the time), not only soon checked the advance of the royalists,
but made them likewise lose the advantage they had gained
a moment before. With that marvellous ascendency which
he exercises over those around him, he succeeded in a short
time in making the <i>picciotti</i> fight, and even in animating the
population which had remained in the houses."</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of the urgent entreaties of his followers not to
expose himself, he remained in the open street, without any
shelter, haranguing and encouraging the men; the enemy
seeing this, issued out from the houses and from behind the
barricade. One of the <i>picciotti</i> was shot through the head
just before Garibaldi, who, seeing him falling, held him up
for a moment; and Colonel Turr, at his side, got a ricochet
ball against his leg as he took hold of the general and
dragged him by main force under shelter. But the effect
was produced. One rush brought the party close enough to
throw one of Orsini's shells, which prostrated seven or eight
men. The bugler, who is always at Garibaldi's side, sounded
the charge, and the Neapolitans ran. The sound of this
bugle seems to act formidably on the nerves of the Neapolitan
troops; they know they have to do with Garibaldi's men,
and at Calata Fimi they ran before even the charge took place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Royal troops were disembarked in the night of the 29th
of May, went out of the Castello toward the Mole, and then
by a circuit, rejoined the troops on the other side, anxious
<a id='Page_324'></a>to hold their ground in and about the royal palace, rather
than to make an attack on the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>The news from the country could not have been better.
Everywhere the people were rising and the troops withdrawing.
On the evening of the 23d, General Alfan di Heisia abandoned
Girgenti. As soon as the troops left, the population hoisted
the Italian flag. A committee was formed, and a national
guard. The cries were, as everywhere else, "<i>Viva l'Italia</i>,"
"<i>Viva Vittorio Emmanuele</i>," and "<i>Viva Garibaldi</i>." The civil
authorities were respected, and although the prisoners, two
hundred in number, were let out, no disturbance occurred.
The whole province there, as everywhere else, followed the
example, rising, instituting a committee, and arming itself.
The province of Catania rose, with the exception of the town,
which was still held by the military, as well as that of Trapani.
And all this occurred before the taking of Palermo.</p>

OF NAPLES' LIBERAL DECREE—REJECTED.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>As soon as Garibaldi landed and went a little way into the
interior, all the most influential members of the aristocracy,
as well as the free communities, asked him to assume the
dictatorship in the name of Victor Emanuel, king of Italy,
and the command in chief of the national army.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first thing, of course, was to organize the military
forces. Until then it was an affair of volunteers, who collected
round one or another influential man of their town or
district, all independent of each other, and remaining
together or going home, as they pleased. A decree of the
19th May, from Salemi, instituted a militia, to which all
belong from 17 to 50; those from 17 to 30 for active
service in the field all over the country; those from 30 to 40
in their provinces, and those from 40 to 50 in their communes.
The officers for the active army are named by the
commander-in-chief, on the proposal of the commanders of
the battalions; those of the second and third categories,
only liable to local service, are chosen by the men themselves.
But it is rather difficult to act up to this decree
under the circumstances. Still, the thing in and about
Palermo made progress. The <i>squadre</i> were now regularly
paid, and probably they could not be kept together if they
were not. They are called "Cacciatori del Etna" (Hunters
of Etna).</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_327'></a>The Sicilian patriots received pay, while the enthusiastic
North Italians, who came to help, had not received a farthing,
and did not expect to receive anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>The native militia wore their brown fustian suit, which is
generally worn all over the country, and is so alike that it
made a very good uniform.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not two months after the last disarmament took place, it
was astonishing what a quantity of guns seemed to be still
in the country. They were, for the most part, short guns,
looking rather like old-fashioned single-barrelled fowling
pieces than muskets. Most of them were percussion, however,
and only a few with the old flint-lock. The longing
for arms was extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might be said of Sicily, at that time, as was said of
Piedmont in central Italy about the same time, by a writer
in Turin:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"There is no pen able to describe, nor imagination strong enough
to conceive, the nature of the present Italian movement. It is a
nation in the struggles of its second birth. Half the youth of the
towns are under arms; young boys of 12 or 13 break their parents'
hearts by declaring themselves, every one of them, irrevocably bent
on becoming soldiers. There are fourteen universities, and at least
four times as many lyceums in the North Italy kingdom, and all of
them are virtually closed, for nearly all the students, and many of the
professors, are under arms. Those scholars whom mature age unfits
for warlike purposes, either sit in parliament, or go out to Palermo to
lend a hand to the provisional Italian government. They are everywhere
organizing themselves into committees, instituting clubs, or '<i>circoli</i>,'
and other political associations, inundating the country with an
evanescent but not inefficient press. There is a universal migration
and transmigration. Venetia and the Marches pour into the
Emilia and Lombardy. The freed provinces muster up volunteers
for Sicily. From Sicily ghost-like or corpse-like state prisoners—the
victims of Bourbon tyranny, the remnants of the wholesale batches
of 1844 and 1848, the old, long-forgotten companions of the Bandiera,
the friends of Poerio, the adventurers of the ill-fated Pisacane's
expedition—creep forth from the battered doors of their prison,
stretch their long-numbed limbs in the sun, gasp in their first
<a id='Page_328'></a>inhalations of free air; then they embark for Genoa, where the warm
sympathy of an applauding multitude awaiting them at their landing
greets their ears, still stunned with the yells and curses of the fellow
galley-slaves they have left behind. Such a sudden and universal
swarming and blending together of the long-severed tribes of the
same race the world never witnessed. Under the Turin porticoes you
hear the pure, sharp Tuscan, the rich, drawling Roman, the lisping
Venetian, the close ringing Neapolitan, as often as the harsh, guttural,
vernacular Piedmontese."</span></p>

<p class='c006'>To account for the different ways in which Garibaldi
treated some of the ecclesiastics in Sicily, two or three facts
should be borne in mind. Innumerable instances have
proved, in our day, as well as in various past ages, that some
of the orders of monks and nuns are naturally predisposed to
be liberal, humane and inoffensive, by the doctrines which
they are taught, their inert state of life, the manner in which
they are brought into partial contact with the world, or the
<a id='Page_330'></a>oppression which they endure from their superiors, while
other classes are inclined in opposite directions by influences
of a contrary nature. Luther probably owed some of his
freedom of thought, and his attachment to the doctrine of
justification by faith, to the system to which he was trained
in his convent, and became acquainted with some of the good
traits of common people, by receiving their daily charity
when a poor boy. The mendicant monks in Palermo, because
they daily mingled with the people and received their
bounty, took a leading part in the insurrection, and were forward
and faithful aids of Garibaldi. The Italian patriots
know how to discriminate between good and bad priests,
many of whom are their enemies, either open or secret, but
some of whom have always been their staunch friends. Several
of the Sicilian exiles in America have acknowledged their
obligations to priests for assistance or for life.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Jesuits! Of them there is never any doubt.
They are always regarded as deadly foes, and are generally
treated very summarily. Exile—immediate expulsion—is the
rule toward them; and this short method, like the suppression
of their society, has been forced upon those whom they
operate against by the necessities of the Jesuits' own creating.
While, therefore, Garibaldi treated some of the clergy with
friendliness and confidence, he turned the Jesuits out of Sicily
almost the first day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The King of Naples, as his father did in the previous revolution,
issued a decree on the 28th of June, promising privileges
to his subjects, and concord with Victor Emanuel: but
his word was utterly despised by the people.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>NAPLES.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>The following is the text of the royal decree:</p>
<p class='c012'>"1. General amnesty.</p>

<p class='c022'>"2. The formation of a new ministry which shall, in the briefest
possible time, draw up a statute on the basis of the Italian and
<a id='Page_331'></a>national representative constitutions. The formation of this ministry
is confided to Commendatore Spinelli.</p>

<p class='c022'>"3. Concord shall be established with the king of Sardinia, for the
interest of both crowns and of Italy.</p>

<p class='c022'>"4. The flag of the kingdom shall be the Italian tricolor with the
royal arms of Naples in the middle.</p>

<p class='c022'>"5. Sicily shall receive analogous institutions, capable of satisfying
the wants of the populations, and shall have a prince of the royal
house for Viceroy.</p>

<p class='c022'>"The Commendatore Spinelli is reported to have laid down the following
conditions for his acceptance of the Presidentship of the
ministry: The immediate banishment of the Queen Mother; impeachment
of the displaced ministry; an immediate publication of the electoral
law, in order to the prompt convocation of parliament; lastly,
an alliance offensive and defensive with Piedmont, with reciprocal
guarantees.</p>

<p class='c022'>"On receiving the dispatches announcing that the king had proclaimed
a constitution at Naples, Garibaldi decided that the Sicilian
committee should assemble on the 18th inst. to vote on a <i>plebiscitum</i>
(universal suffrage,) proposing immediate annexation to Piedmont.</p>

<p class='c022'>"The fundamental point of the programme of the commander
Spinelli, was the formation of an Italian Confederation, as recommended
by the emperor of the French. This confederation to be
essentially of a defensive character, and the independence of every
State to be maintained, although national unity may be favored."</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Medici, who had been an officer of Garibaldi in
South America, and afterward in Rome and Lombardy,
raised and directed several corps of volunteers, who in June
enthusiastically enlisted under the country's standard in
Piedmont, and hastened to Sicily at different times. The
following account of the expedition of the 8th of that month,
is abridged from a private letter, written in the form of a
journal, by one of the volunteers. It begins on "Thursday,
the 14th of June, on board the ship Washington, lying off
Cagliari," a small port of Piedmont a little east from Genoa:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='small'>"I little thought on Friday night, as I went to Cornigliano to witness
the departure of the 1,200 volunteers, in the clipper Charles and
Jane, that on the following night we ourselves should be <i>en route</i> to
Sicily. Yet so it was. Our intention had been to wait for the third
expedition. On the 8th of June came dispatches from Garibaldi, quite
different from any previous ones, asking for men; so at 3, <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>,
on the 9th, A—— went to Medici, and was at once accepted. I followed,
and with the same success. Our rendezvous was for 9, <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>,
at Cornigliano. Toward evening we learned from fresh dispatches
that the Neapolitan troops had evacuated Palermo; this made us
hesitate, as for a thousand and one reasons we should prefer the third
<a id='Page_333'></a>expedition: but calculating that if there should be nothing to do in
Sicily, we could return, we took a carriage at midnight and drove off
to Cornigliano. The gardens of the Villa della Ponsona, where was
the rendezvous for the volunteers, were deserted, and we could see
the two steamers lying at anchor off Sestri. A little fishing-boat was
lying on the shore, so we coaxed the men to push off, and entered;
we found it ankle deep in water, and in about ten minutes were
climbing up the vessel's side. Medici had furnished us with a letter to
the commander, who gave us a first-rate cabin, and told us that we
were the first on board. Some delay had been occasioned by the
little steamer Oregon jostling against the Washington in coming out
of the port of Genoa; but with the exception of smashing the woodwork
near the paddle-box, and breaking away a portion of the rails
of the upper deck, no great damage was done. For a while we sat
on deck, watching the volunteers coming up. Genoa looked more
beautiful than ever, the moonlight flooding her marble palaces and
spires; and almost the only constellation visible between the fleecy
clouds was Cassiopeia, Garibaldi's star, by whose light he wended his
way at night-time across the mountains that divide Genoa from Nice,
when condemned to death by Charles Albert, in 1834.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"The expedition was composed of—ship Charles and Jane, of Bath
(U.S.), left Genoa at midnight, 8th June, in tow of steamer L'Utile,
with 1,200 men, under command of Major Corti.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Steamship Franklin, left Genoa at 10, <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, 9th June, for Leghorn,
to receive on board 800 men, under command of Colonel Malenchini.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Steamer Oregon, left Genoa 10th June, 4, <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, with 200 men,
under command of Major Caldesi.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Steamship Washington, of New York, flag ship, Captain Wm. De Rohan,
of Philadelphia, with 1,400 men, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Baldisseratto, an officer of the Sardinian navy, left Genoa at
half-past three, <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, 10th June.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Total effective force of 3,600 men, well equipped and armed, the
whole under the command of Colonel Medici, accompanied by a full
staff.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"There was plenty of food on board, but no getting at it. No one
murmured; indeed the patience and cheerfulness of the volunteers
are beyond all praise. Some of them, many of them, are from the
first Italian families, who have never known a hardship in their lives;
here they cannot even lie down to sleep, but huddle together, rolled
up like balls; many have to stand all night. We had a long chat
with twenty of the famous Carabinieri of Genoa, who are going out
to reinforce their company, of whom, out of thirty-five in one attack,
<a id='Page_334'></a>six were killed and fifteen wounded. These twenty seem to dream
of naught save a like fate.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>they sing. One's faith in humanity increases wonderfully here.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"On the morning of the 11th, we passed Caprera, Garibaldi's Island,
coasted along Sardinia all the day, and at 6, <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, on the 12th,
anchored off Cagliari. Medici hired two brigs, and dividing the
volunteers into three portions, gave them breathing room. They
looked extremely well in their simple uniform, white trousers and
grey or blue blouse, faced with red. It is a pity, considering the heat
of Sicily, they have not retained the regular Garibaldi hat, which
would have sheltered the face somewhat. By the way, we have
the famous Englishman, Captain Peard, on board; he missed Garibaldi's
expedition, and is now going to join him; he is captain of the
2d Pavia brigade—a handsome man, with long hair, beard tinged
with grey; blue, English eyes, and an honest English heart, much
amused at the absurd stories that have been told about him—a true
military man, and a worshipper of Garibaldi, intent on doing his
utmost for Italian independence.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Captain De Rohan, too, is a character. I am not at liberty to
tell you how much we owe to him for his exertions and pecuniary
sacrifices in this expedition. If the Neapolitans respect these 3,600
Sicilian exiles going home, we may thank the stars and stripes under
which we sail.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Medici would be in trouble, as he has positive orders from Cavour
not to go; and this is natural. Cavour could not act otherwise
since his advice was asked. Medici, had he wanted to do it, should.
Medici is a splendid soldier and a good patriot.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Before quitting Milazzo, I must tell you that I visited the citadel,
the field of battle, and other places of interest, besides making the
personal acquaintance of Garibaldi, and all the persons of note and
interest staying here. Among others, none possess a larger share of
the latter, for our countrymen at least, than Captain Peard,
'Garibaldi's Englishman,' a fine English gentleman, and not the
melo-dramatic hero that people at home are fondly led to believe. I
saw him for the first time under circumstances highly contributing to
enhance the interest with which reputation and curiosity have invested
him. He had left the café where he had taken up his quarters, and was
walking quietly toward the shore, accompanied by his friends, and a few
other persons."</span></p>

<p class='c006'><a id='Page_335'></a>Captain Peard was frequently mentioned, as a volunteer
in the corps of Garibaldi, or at least in his company, during
his daring and perilous, but successful career in Lombardy in
1859. The public have never been informed whether he
was actually an officer and soldier of the Cacciatori delle
Alpi, or only accompanied that incomparable band.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi's Englishman, Captain J. W. Peard, wrote as
follows to a friend at Florence, from Palermo, June 22d:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Here we are, all safe, although I hear the papers say the contrary.
We left Genoa with three steamers, one of which ran on to Leghorn,
to embark laborers for the Isthmus of Suez, and after a good passage,
got into Cagliari. Not so the American clipper, wit a battalion on
board, that sailed 24 hours before us. The Neapolitans fell in with her
off Cape Corso, and captured her. She is now, with all her cargo, both
alive and dead, at Naples. Yesterday the American man-of-war on the
station sailed for that port to demand her peremptorily. She was taken
on the high seas, not in Neapolitan waters—therefore her capture is an
act of piracy by the law of nations. Notwithstanding that loss, we
landed 2,500 men and large supplies of Enfield rifles and ammunition.</span></p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Palermo is in a frightful state from the bombardment. Accounts
vary as to the number of shells thrown into the city; but the best
report I can get gives them at about 800. The Toledo is in places
quite blocked up with ruins. Near the palace nearly an entire street
is burned. In other parts ruins meet you at every step. At present
the people are hard at work removing the barricades and levelling
the Castellamare, from which the shells were thrown. All the works
toward the city are to be razed to the ground. The people are wild
with joy at their deliverance. A friend of mine asked a man yesterday
if it was a festa. 'Yes, signore, every day is a festa now,' he
said, with tears rising to his eyes. Those who were present tell me
never was anything like Garibaldi's entry into the city. He had not
above 600 available men, besides the Sicilian levies, and the enemy was
20,000 strong. Extraordinary are the ravages of the royal troops—villas
sacked and burned. I was in one yesterday that belonged to
the Neapolitan minister, Cavona. They had destroyed everything
they could not carry away. The floor was strewed with broken mirrors,
chandeliers, marbles, busts, vases, etc. His own room they had
piled up with furniture, and tried to set the building on fire. In
another villa a valuable library was totally destroyed, the torn books
<a id='Page_336'></a>being as high as a man's waist. I saw some Spanish MSS., royal
decrees, etc., which would be invaluable to Sicilian historians, torn to
pieces. After the armistice the royalists sacked upward of a thousand
houses, and committed numberless murders."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>Messina, the second city in Sicily, capitulated to General
Medici, on the 28th of June. The commander, Field Marshal
De Clary, stated that he was animated by sentiments of humanity,
and wished to avoid the bloodshed which would have
been caused on the one hand by the occupation of Messina,
and on the other by the defence of the town and forts. The
terms were:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"1. That the royal troops shall abandon the town of Messina, without
being disturbed, and the town shall be occupied by the Sicilian
troops, without the latter, on their part, being disturbed by the royal
troops.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"2. The royal troops shall evacuate Gonzaga and Castellaccio after
a delay of two days, to commence from the date of the signature of
the present convention. Each of the two contracting parties shall
appoint two officers and a commissioner to make an inventory of the
cannon, stores and provisions; in short, of everything in the
above-named forts at the time of their evacuation.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"3. The embarkation of the royal troops shall take place without
disturbance from the Sicilians.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"4. The royal troops shall remain in possession of the citadel, and
the forts of Don Blasco, Santerna, and San Salvadore, but shalt have
no power to do damage to the town, except in the event of those
works being attacked, or of works of attack being constructed in the
town itself.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"5. A strip of ground parallel and contiguous to the military zone
shall be neutralized.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"6. Communication by sea remains completely free to both sides, etc.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"In the last place, the signers of the present convention shall have
the liberty of agreeing on the subject of the inherent necessities of
civil life which will have to be satisfied and provided for in the town
of Messina, in respect of the royal troops.</span></p>

<p class='c006'><a id='Page_337'></a>Messina and other cities of Italy were all captured or
otherwise secured by the patriots, under various and highly
interesting circumstances; but the particulars cannot be here
recounted for want of space. The following account of
Garibaldi's reception in Messina is from the pen of an eye-witness,
and contains a just description of the simple manners
and habits which he retains under all circumstances:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"At the appointed hour we went to the palace, where about forty
or fifty persons were assembled. The banquet passed off very quietly
and happily. Garibaldi, as I had noticed before, is very temperate at
his meals, drinks water only, and very quickly rises immediately after
he has finished, and returning to his office, resumes his business,
which he dispatches with remarkable promptitude and ease—no hurry,
no confusion, no excitement, even in the most pressing emergencies.
On the present occasion he spent a little more time over his dinner,
and after dessert he wrote, and chatted with those present. While at
dinner a public band of music, improvised for the occasion, playing in
the street in front, where a large number of people had assembled,
who kept up a round of cheering when anything occurred, such as an
arrival of a detachment of volunteers or some public favorite, to excite
their curiosity and interest.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The great event of the evening, however, came off some time
later, when the palace having been illuminated, Garibaldi went on the
balcony leading out of the banqueting room, for the purpose of showing
himself to the people and addressing them. On making his appearance,
a tremendous ovation was offered to the liberator by the Messinians.
The applause, the cheering—genuine cheering—the clapping of hands, and
the manifestations of joy and approbation, were of the most hearty and
enthusiastic character. When this demonstration had quite subsided,
which required great perseverance and some time to effect, Garibaldi
proceeded to address the people. The thousands of upturned faces were
all directed toward him, and amid a silence as still as the grave he
spoke. The substance of his speech was to this effect: He said that he
presented himself to them because they wished it, but that he himself
objected to such exhibitions. He did not play the comedian; he was for
deeds, not words. They had achieved a great triumph, but the time was
come when they must achieve still greater. He thanked the Sicilians for
the courage and enthusiasm they displayed in effecting their own
deliverance, and said if they were true to themselves, not Sicily only,
<a id='Page_338'></a>but with the blessing of Providence, the whole of Italy, would be
liberated. He therefore urged upon them the necessity of still following
up the good work, and invited them to come forward and enroll themselves
in the ranks of their liberators. I need not dwell on the enthusiasm
which this address excited; it was of the most vehement
character I ever witnessed. After acknowledging its cordial reception
for a few moments, Garibaldi withdrew."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>Garibaldi had various difficulties in arranging his government,
the causes of which may, perhaps, not yet have been
fully explained. We will, therefore, only mention some of
the leading facts. Farina, Grasselli, and Toti, whom Garibaldi
had found very troublesome to him in Palermo,
were sent out of the island, because, according to the
official journal, they were "affiliated to the police of the
continent," and had "conspired against order." The ministry
resigned in consequence, and a new one was formed,
including Messrs. Amari, the historian, Emeranti, and the
following members of the old: Logothe, Laporta, and
Orsini. Reports were published, from time to time, in
Sicily, as afterward in Naples, accusing Republicans of
efforts to counteract Garibaldi: but as the enemies of Italy
have long showed their malice chiefly against the Republicans,
of whom Garibaldi has been one, and as Mazzini himself
had declared his ardent adhesion to the cause of united
Italy under Victor Emanuel, such accusations are generally
suspicious.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following letter from Victor Emanuel to Garibaldi,
and the reply, brief as they are, are two of the most important
documents connected with the war, and, indeed, with
the lives of their two distinguished writers. It is a most
impressive truth, and must ever be regarded as a proof of
Garibaldi's sound judgment, independence, resolution and
impregnable firmness, in a great and glorious cause, at an
epoch of his career when nothing else gave the right turn to
the results then pending. On which side the "statesmanship"
then lay, when the king wrote such a veto, with
<a id='Page_339'></a>Cavour sitting at his right hand, and Garibaldi disobeyed it,
standing alone, the world can determine, both now and
hereafter.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><b>LETTER FROM VICTOR EMANUEL TO GARIBALDI.</b></h4>

<p class='c019'>"<span class='sc'>Dear General</span>: <span class='small'>You know that when you started for Sicily you
did not have my approbation. To-day, considering the gravity of
existing circumstances, I decide upon giving you a warning, being
aware of the sincerity of your sentiments for me.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"In order to put an end to a war between Italians and Italians, I
counsel you to renounce the idea of passing with your valorous troops
to the Neapolitan mainland, provided that the King of Naples consents
to evacuate the whole of the island, and to leave the Sicilians
free to deliberate upon and to settle their destinies.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"I would reserve to myself full liberty of action relative to Sicily in
the event of the King of Naples being unable to accept this condition.
General, follow my advice, and you will see that it is useful
to Italy, whose power of augmenting her merits you would facilitate
by showing to Europe that even as she knows how to conquer, so
does she know how to make a good use of her victory."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>Garibaldi replied to the king as follows:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Sire</span>: <span class='small'>Your majesty knows the high esteem and the devotion
which I feel toward your majesty; but such is the present state of
things in Italy, that, at the present moment, I cannot obey your
majesty's injunctions, much as I should like it. I am called for and
urged on by the people of Naples. I have tried in vain, with what
influence I had, to restrain them, feeling, as I do, that a more
favorable moment would be desirable. But if I should now hesitate, I
should endanger the cause of Italy, and not fulfill my duty as an
Italian. May your majesty, therefore, permit me this time not to
obey! As soon as I shall have done with the task imposed upon me
by the wishes of the people, who groan under the tyranny of the
Neapolitan Bourbon, I shall lay down my sword at your majesty's
feet, and shall obey your majesty for the remainder of my lifetime.</span></p>

<p class='c006'>Garibaldi had now been forbidden by the king to attempt
any further conquests, and warned not to attempt to dethrone
the King of Naples; and he had declared that he should do
both. From that moment Victor Emanuel was virtually
proclaimed "King of Italy," in spite of his own will and
word. What induced Victor to write that letter may
easily be imagined; what induced his prime minister to
dictate it, will probably be always a matter of conjecture.
Garibaldi's reply, and the measures which he subsequently
adopted, with the results to which they led, will ever stand
on record, where they can be read by the present and succeeding
generations; and the world will form their own
opinions of his character and capacity, without the aid of
many comments or explanations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much was said and conjectured respecting the dissension
which had existed before this time, between Garibaldi and
Farina, a particular friend of Count Cavour. Garibaldi had
appointed Farina counsellor at Palermo, and afterward dismissed
him. It appears, even from Farina's own statement,
that it did not arise from any disposition in Garibaldi to
<a id='Page_341'></a>establish a republic, or otherwise to prevent the final annexation
of Sicily to the kingdom of Sardinia, but was merely
to postpone it for a time which he thought more favorable.
It appears from other evidence, that Farina wished to have
severe measures taken against some of the Republicans, but
that Garibaldi rejected the proposal with noble scorn; and
to prevent his further interference, banished him and two
others from Sicily, by the following decree:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"'Signor La Farina, Grasselli and Toti, are affiliated to the police
of the Continent. The three were expelled for having conspired
against order. The government, which watches over public tranquillity,
could not tolerate the presence of such individuals.'</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The 'Opinione National' of Turin, stated that Farina had full
power from the Sardinian government to assume the title of royal
commissioner, as soon as annexation was declared. Garibaldi, while
advocating annexation, thought it advisable that his dictatorship should
continue till the whole island was subjected, and finding that the
presence of Farina was detrimental to the cause, he ordered him off."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>La Farina afterward published the following explanation:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"The causes of my difference with General Garibaldi were as follow:
I believed, and still believe, that the only salvation for Sicily is
immediate annexation to the constitutional kingdom of Victor
Emanuel, the most ardent wish of all the Sicilians, already manifested
by the chiefs of more than three hundred municipal bodies. General
Garibaldi believed that the annexation should be postponed till the
liberation of all Italy, including Venetia and Rome, had been effected.
I believed that it was a great act of imprudence to confide a share of
authority and of the public forces to unpopular ministers, etc."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>There was now a general suspension of hostilities. The
entire island of Sicily was quiet, and none of the king's
troops remained, except in a few of the fortresses. The circumstances
under which some of these had been captured, or
been forced to cease resistance, are interesting, but with the
exception of Palermo, they have not been given for want of
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strait between Sicily and Calabria has been invested
<a id='Page_342'></a>with peculiar interest to readers of history from early ages.
The rocks and quicksands of Scylla and Charybdis, with the
fabulous sirens of which we read in Virgil in our youth,
give us impressions which are never lost. But there are
more modern associations with that arm of the sea and its
shores, of more real importance in the view of persons acquainted
with them. American ships have long visited Palermo,
Messina, Catania, and some of the other ports of Sicily,
and oranges are brought to us from that fruitful island,
many of which grow on the opposite coast of Calabria, or
Magna Grecia, as it was formerly called. Hills arise from
near the water, and mountains appear behind them, where
scenes of rocky barrenness are intermingled with valleys of
verdure and fertility, inhabited by a population in a simple
state of society, the descendants of ancient Greeks, mingled
with races which at successive periods came in from different
countries. These had been for ages subject to the degrading
influences of Romish spiritual rule, and of the despots
of various countries, especially those of Spain and the Bourbons.
But the seeds of intelligence have been assiduously
sown and cherished of late years by the patriotic societies
of Italy, who by their cautious, yet often daring and hazardous
efforts, have long since brought many of the poor and
rude, but brave and faithful Calabrians into the band of
Italian unity. The events of late years had proved that the
people of that part of the peninsula were to some extent
connected with the great union; but the approach of Garibaldi
and his reception have since shown that the influences so
long and so secretly at work had not been justly appreciated.
There was no considerable insurrection in Calabria during the
conquest of Sicily, and it might have been presumed, from
the general quietness of the population, that they were
unable or unwilling to join with the patriots against the
government of the King of Naples. Some practised observers
of Italian affairs, however, regarded that general
tranquillity as the best evidence of a general concert, and
<a id='Page_343'></a>looked for a general rising of the people when the hour
should arrive, and the signal should be given. Garibaldi, in
the whole course of his proceedings, acted as if he had information
not known to others; and a review of events, since
they have passed, and are now fresh in our memory, is calculated
to confirm us in this opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the long and anxious suspense which occurred before
any movement was made against Calabria, questions were
asked, how the flotilla of boats, which Garibaldi was collecting
on the coast of Sicily, could be risked across the
strait without a single ship of war to convoy them, and with
only two small steamers and one larger one to tow them,
while a squadron of the king's steamers was cruising
between the shores, and the landing-place was strongly
defended by three forts, with heavy cannon, and the whole
Calabrian coast was occupied by royal troops. The currents,
so terrible to mariners in ancient times, are still violent
and irregular.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was natural to ask, What is coming? What is about
to happen? Are the apprehensions of Victor to be realized?
Has the king a clearer sight than his gallant precursor,
who has hitherto proved his prudence an equal match
with his valor? Is this famous strait to prove its fatal
character, so long ago recorded in fable; and is this passage
then, so dreadful to mariners, to be the destruction of our
noble sailor? Will he pass safely between Scylla and Charybdis,
or meet his end on one or the other? On which
and how will he be wrecked; and by what unfortunate circumstances?
Not far distant from this spot, on a point
on the coast of Calabria, the two Bandieras, sons of
an Austrian admiral, but true Italian patriots, were decoyed
to their death, by means of letters violated in the British
postoffice. Has Garibaldi been made a dupe, by any artifice;
and has Victor been apprised of danger? Has Louis
Napoleon once more changed his policy, and, after favoring
Italy in her "latest victories," as Garibaldi recently
<a id='Page_344'></a>acknowledged, has he prepared, in consistency with his conduct in
1849, a scheme for something on the opposite side?</p>

<p class='c007'>These, and many other questions, naturally disturbed the
minds of the friends of Italy, while standing in reality or in
fancy on the shore of Sicily, and looking in vain for any sign
of the fate which awaited him on the other coast? But,
when we turned, even in imagination, to observe Garibaldi,
there was, as ever, something to dispel apprehension, and to
encourage the highest hopes; for, as that patriot priest-poet,
Dall'Ongaro wrote:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>"O, well you might say that a saint was his mother,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>For there a mild brilliancy beams in his eyes,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Which sure was sent down from Paradise."</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But on the morning of the 8th of August, Garibaldi began
to collect his troops near Faro, which amounted to 15,000
or 18,000 men, without counting the garrison of Messina. The
Point of Faro had the appearance of a vast fortified camp,
being covered with cannon of all sizes, from mountain
howitzers to English 68-pounders, ready to be embarked in the
three steamers, which were under steam; while 300 boats
were drawn up ready to receive Garibaldi's troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>About midnight twenty-five or thirty boats sailed from the
coast of Sicily. They were going to attempt a first landing. In
three quarters of an hour they crossed to the other side.
Unfortunately the current did not permit them to keep the order
of their position. Some were driven toward Faro, others
swept under the forts of Scylla; some ran fast on sandbanks
further south, while others again were thrown toward Pizzo.
The soldiers, however, did not lose their courage at this
misfortune. Two or three hundred were landed in all haste, and
the flotilla returned to Faro without accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the morning of the 10th a new attempt was made,
under the command of an old officer of the French marine
service, M. Deflotte: but scarcely had this expedition appeared
on the coast, when the enemy rushed upon them from
<a id='Page_345'></a>a thousand ambuscades, vineyards, gardens, ditches, and
houses. A sharp firing ensued: two Garibaldians were
wounded, and the expedition was compelled to return, not,
however, without having vigorously responded to the fire of
the Neapolitans.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the night of the 10th and 11th, another landing was
vainly attempted. The Neapolitan squadron came up nearer
to Faro, and watched every movement of the Garibaldians.
The day of the 11th was passed in embarking the artillery.
A desperate attempt was spoken of for the next night.
At seven o'clock in the evening the Garibaldian steamers
began to fire up, and the troops placed themselves in readiness
for embarking; but at eleven o'clock a counter-order
arrived. About one o'clock in the night was heard a loud
cannonade; the firing extended from the forts of Scylla to the
fortifications of Pizzo. The squadron remained silent; the
engagement had therefore taken place on the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed to be evident that the forts were simultaneously
attacked by the volunteers and the Calabrians. At a quarter
past two the firing ceased: it recommenced after a quarter
of an hour in order to cease again after a few minutes. At
daybreak, a small boat, chased by a Neapolitan corvette,
sought protection under the guns of Faro.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small party destined to land first in Calabria were
under Major Missori, and had been picked from the different
volunteer corps. They had been ordered to land on the opposite
coast between Scylla and Forte del Cavallo. It is on the
extreme point of the Calabrian shore that these forts are
situate, at a little distance one from the other. The castle of
Scylla stands upon a rock, quite inaccessible from the seaside.
Forte del Cavallo is a little further to the left of it, and
its walls and fortifications slope gradually down toward the
road which skirts the sea, very much like that from Nice to
Genoa, which is called the Corniche Road.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Wednesday evening, the sky so generally blue and
bright in this country, was covered with dense whitish clouds,
<a id='Page_346'></a>and the night, therefore, was very dark. Garibaldi, who
knows how to take advantage even of the smallest incident,
at once ordered Missori to sail. Major Missori, having embarked
his men on board of large fishing vessels, consequently
started at half-past nine o'clock from the Sicilian shore. The
Neapolitan cruisers steaming up and down the straits, though
numerous and powerful, did not seem to possess the eyes of
Argus, and therefore the little expedition was able to land
at the intended point. Before reaching the Calabrian coast,
however, one of the boats parted company from the other,
and sailed a little down toward Scylla Point, just where a
Neapolitan battery had been erected. The men on guard
in this battery gave the alarm, and the boat was fired at and
one English volunteer wounded. Garibaldi had ordered
Missori to endeavor to surprise the garrison of Fort Scylla,
and to capture the fort. But on hearing the rattling of
musketry, and the report of a gun on his left, Missori rightly
thought that it would be impossible to seize Fort Scylla by
surprise. He therefore hastened to make the concerted signal,
informing the Dictator that he had safely landed, and
he and his men ascended the rough paths into the Calabrian
mountains. As for his companions in the boat which had
missed its way, they returned to the Sicilian shore to relate
the cause of their failure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Menotti, Garibaldi's eldest son, arrived at night from
Palermo with 800 of the volunteers of Bertani's last expedition.
The Dictator had then 20,000 or 25,000 men. His
army had been formed into four divisions. That of Medici
was at Messina, watching the movements of the Neapolitans,
who still held the citadel; the other three were partly concentrated
at Faro, a brigade posted at Milazzo and Barcelona,
and another, under Bixio, was sent to Bronte, in the
province of Catania.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the evening of August 11th, fires were seen on
the Calabrian mountains behind Pizzo. They were evidently
signals made to Garibaldi by the Calabrian bands which
<a id='Page_347'></a>had joined the expedition of Major Missori. From about
half-past ten, firing was heard in the direction of Fort Scylla;
but as that place is hidden from view by the land about
Torre del Cavallo, nothing could be clearly distinguished
except the heavy boom of artillery. The Neapolitan steamers
were cruizing all night, as usual; but they did not fire,
and only made signals with rockets. It is supposed that the
firing was caused by an attack made by Major Missori's party
on Fort Scylla.</p>

MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE—THE EXPEDITION PREPARED
IN SARDINIA—HIS CHANGE OF PLANS—SAILS FROM
GIARDINI, AND LANDS AT REGGIO.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>A new epoch in the war had now arrived, and one of the
highest interest. What might be the results none could
easily conjecture with any degree of confidence, because the
grounds of calculation were known only to Garibaldi. His
friends in America as well as in Europe were anxious, fearing
that some great disappointment might then await him, after
all his brilliant successes. He was about to land on a wild
coast, lined with strong forts, garrisoned with numerous
troops, and guarded by war-steamers, while not a sign could
be discovered of any friends prepared to join him. He, it
was to be presumed, had secret information, on which he
was acting; but might not that be erroneous or deceptive?
Reliance, however, was generally placed on his prudence and
skill, and all waited impatiently to see whether he would
succeed in this independent enterprise, undertaken against
the command of his friend and king.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, just when things appeared to be all prepared for a
descent upon the Calabrian coast, new anxiety and great
surprise were caused by the sudden disappearance of the
chief. Garibaldi had disappeared, leaving behind him the
proclamation which closes the last chapter. He had left his
trusted and faithful friend Sirtori in his place; but why
<a id='Page_349'></a>or whither had he gone, or when he would return, no one
could even conjecture. The explanation is now easily given;
for the facts were known after the reasons for concealing them
had ceased. Garibaldi, it now appears, had been acting in
a manner quite consistent with himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the middle of August, 6,000 men were collected
by Dr. Bertani, Garibaldi's agent in Genoa, for an expedition
to the states of the Pope. They were sent in
detachments to the little retired Golfo d'Orangio, on the
eastern side of the island of Sardinia. Bertani went to
Messina for orders from Garibaldi, having been urged by
Farina and Major Trecchi not to complicate matters by
invading the Papal territories before the question of Naples
was settled. It was to Golfo d'Orangio that Garibaldi
went secretly on the 12th. The "chivalrous regard" which
he has been said to have for Victor Emanuel, as the head
of Italian unity, seems to have induced him to consent, and
the 6,000 men were ordered to Sicily. One thousand of them
were therefore sent round the island of Sicily, to Taormina,
with the intention of invading Calabria with the brigade
Bixio, on the south coast. This was a characteristic plan
of Garibaldi, when all eyes were turned to the Straits, as
he is fond of making surprises, especially to attack in the
rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi therefore left Messina on the 18th of August,
for Giardini, by land, where the troops arrived before him;
and the materiel and horses were shipped at night, in the
two steamers, Torino and Franklin, which had transported
thither about 2,800 soldiers. These and others—9,000 in all—were
embarked in these steamers and two sail vessels, which
were taken in tow. Garibaldi and his son accompanied this
first brigade, which was to be followed by the second, and
both were to act in combination with the expedition across
the Strait.</p>

<p class='c007'>At dawn of day the two steamers entered the harbor of
Melito, without opposition, about twelve miles south of
<a id='Page_350'></a>Reggio, and east of Capo dell'Armi. But, unfortunately on
approaching the shore, one of them, the Torino, got aground,
and efforts were made in vain to get her off. Garibaldi,
seeing that the case was a serious one, said that he was
needed to examine the bottom, and began to throw off his
clothes, preparatory to diving. But his sailors were too
quick, for ten or twelve of them leaped over the side of the
vessel into the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he intended to take Reggio by surprise, he hastened
on shore, and effected a landing, with three cannon, in a
wonderfully short time. Knowing that almost all the
enemy's troops were down at the forts on the west coast,
from Scylla onward, he lost no time, expected no assistance,
and gave them not time to learn of his arrival in their rear,
but speedily gained the neighboring heights. A frigate and
corvette in the King of Naples' service were posted on the
watch exactly off the spot at which Garibaldi landed, but,
wonderful to relate, they not only did not sink his ship, but
opposed no serious obstacle to his disembarkation, although
they fired some shots which killed a few of the Garibaldians.
Four thousand insurrectionists in the Calabrias fraternized
with Garibaldi almost on the moment of his landing. It
was rumored also, that the defection of the army of Naples
was extremely probable.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now return to Faro, where the army was left still
anxiously looking across the strait:</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Nothing was heard of Missori's expedition till it was reported
in the camp that he had established himself at Aspromonte, a small
village in the mountains near the Calabrian shore. But before reaching
this place, he had to fight a company of Neapolitan riflemen,
which was dispatched from Villa San Giovanni to stop his march. The
skirmish was a sharp one, but at last Missori had the best of it, and
was enabled to make his way through the mountains without much
difficulty. In this affair, however, he had seven men wounded, and
one was made a prisoner by the Neapolitans, as he was so severely
hurt that he could not move. In spite of the remonstrances of the
surgeon, who told the Neapolitan officer that the man would die if he
<a id='Page_351'></a>were taken to Reggio, he was removed, and died on the road. Missori
held Aspromonte, and Calabrian patriots joined him from the
neighboring villages of the coast: 150 men of Villa San Giovanni,
commanded by a Calabrian baron, were among the number.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"During the course of the night, other small expeditions sailed
from Sicily, notwithstanding the shining moon which made the night
as clear and bright as the day.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The first of them was directed to land between Azzerello and Villa San
Giovanni. The second successfully landed at Fiumara Zaccherella.
The third reached Cannamiele. In all, these three expeditions
did not number more than 300 men."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>Few scenes in history can be found, to be compared with
those which soon followed the landing of Garibaldi and his
troops, in the manner and at the different points, above
mentioned. His combined movements show the wisdom, as
well as the ingenuity of his plans; and the results were probably
more favorable even than his anticipations. While
amusing the enemy with his preparations, and making his
repeated essays to land on the near parts of the coast, he had
suddenly got in their rear with a powerful force; and while
the line of forts along the shore were expecting an attack in
front, they suddenly discovered the hills behind and above
them covered with Garibaldi's army. Their consternation
may be imagined, and some idea may be formed, by an active
fancy, of the feelings of the soldiers of freedom, as they
showed themselves on the lofty heights, which they had
attained unperceived, and from which they now looked down
into the enemy's forts, and saw what passed, being able to
distinguish minute objects and the positions and motions of
the men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi sent a summons to the enemy, demanding an
immediate surrender. A flag of truce soon appeared, proceeding
from below, with a request for an armistice of a few
hours, until orders could be received from the commander-in-chief.
"You will never receive them," replied Garibaldi.
"I have cut off all communications." "What do you
require?" was the next question. "Surrender." "On
<a id='Page_352'></a>what terms? May we march out with our arms?" "Certainly;
and all the troops will be at liberty to return to
their homes."</p>

<p class='c007'>When the messenger returned to the fortress, there was a
commotion visible—men running about to spread the news;
and a moment after, a loud shout arose, of "Viva Garibaldi!"
But little time was required to arrange the capitulation,
and then Garibaldi descended the heights and entered
the place, where he was received with acclamations, and the
warmest expressions of joy. The soldiers crowded round,
kissed his hands and hailed him as their friend. Thus
relieved from all their apprehensions in a moment, and,
instead of a scene of battle and bloodshed, of which they had
expectations, and the forebodings of defeat and its consequences,
they found themselves treated with the humanity
and tenderness so universally displayed by their conqueror,
and at liberty to leave their hard and miserable military life,
and to return to their homes and families. The Calabrians,
who had already joined the patriot army in great numbers,
were continually pouring in from the country; and they,
being in want of arms and ammunition to equip them for the
ranks of the liberator, purchased those of the disbanded
soldiers, who having no intention of remaining in the service
of the king, were glad to sell what they no more desired to
use against their brethren.</p>

<p class='c007'>The capture of the forts was thus a scene of peaceful jubilee,
and effected without shedding a drop of blood. The
results of Garibaldi's proceedings now showed that he must
have laid his plans and pursued his movements on information
before received, and which fully justified them at every
step. His progress, from that part of Calabria toward
Naples, afforded equal evidence of his sagacity and of the
preparations made to facilitate and secure it. The people rose
in his favor wherever he came, and insurrections were made
in different and some distant parts of the country, often
with a boldness and success which proved extensive and well-laid
<a id='Page_353'></a>combinations. To secret societies and the patriotism of
the people belongs the credit of that great and almost bloodless
revolution. The following brief account of proceedings
in several places may serve as a specimen of the movements
in the country.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Three thousand men, assembled from Polla, Sant'Angelo, San Rufo,
and a number of other places, marched into Sala, commanded by Colonel
Fabrizii. There, in the presence of an enthusiastic population, the
downfall of the Bourbons was declared, and the government of Victor
Emanuel established, with Garibaldi as dictator, and Giovanni Matina
as pro-dictator. A <i>procès verbal</i> of the whole affair was made, and
signed by the authorities. In western Lucania, under the direction
of Stefano Passaro, a committee was appointed to collect arms and
ammunition, another to collect voluntary offerings, and a third to
provide for public security. Three of the four districts of the
province of Salerno, Campagna Vallo, and Sala, had already risen.
Of the insurrection, or rather of the popular festivity in Vallo, we
have these details: that on the 29th the <i>tambour</i> was beaten at 2
<span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, when the male population rushed in arms to the <i>piazza</i> of the
city. They were shortly after joined by many of the youth of the
neighboring communes, and, forming themselves into a column, with
music at their head, they went through the streets, taking down the
arms of the Bourbons and substituting those of Victor Emanuel. All
the women of the place accompanied them, scattering flowers and
confetti, and thus, amid tears of joy, they all marched toward
Goi.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The scene is described as having been one of marvellous enthusiasm,
and it is added that not a single quarrel or theft took place.
Life, order, and property were religiously respected."</span></p>

benevolence, we have determined to grant constitutional and
representative institutions to our kingdom, in harmony with national and
Italian principles, so as to guarantee future security and prosperity,
and to draw always closer the bonds which unite us to the people
whom Providence has called us to govern. For this object we have
arrived at the following determinations:</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"1. We grant a general amnesty for all political offenders up to this
day.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"2. We have charged the Commander, Don Antonio Spinelli, with the
formation of a new ministry, who shall compile, in the shortest
possible time, the articles of the statute, on the basis of
representative, Italian, and national institutions.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"3. An agreement will be established with the King of Sardinia
for the common interests of the two crowns in Italy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"4. Our flag shall be from this day forward adorned with the
<a id='Page_355'></a>national colors in vertical bands, preserving always the arms of our
dynasty in the centre.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"5. As regards Sicily, we will grant it analogous representative
institutions, such as to satisfy the wants of the island; and one of the
princes of our royal house shall be our viceroy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>"<span class='sc'>Portici</span>, <i>June 25, 1860</i>."</p>
<p class='c006'>A letter from Naples of that date, said:</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Wrung from the sovereign as have been these concessions,
against his inclinations and convictions, if his majesty can be said to
have any, and known as all these facts are, the decree was received
with the greatest indifference. People read it on the walls and passed
on. I have not heard one cry of pleasure raised, but I have heard
official people say. 'Too late! What a pity that it was not given six
months ago.' It was the concession of one with his back to the wall,
and who may hereafter say, as Ferdinand II. said, that he yielded on
compulsion, and it was not binding.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"An order was given for the immediate release of the political
prisoners in Santa Maria Apparente, and a steamer, hired by their
friends, went to Capri to-day to bring back the victims of a long and
cruel persecution."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>Everywhere this decree was regarded in the same manner.
The celebrated Poerio, who had been released from a long
and cruel imprisonment a few months before, for supporting
the constitution to which the father of the present King of
Naples had himself sworn, was at this time a member of the
House of Deputies of Sardinia, and in a speech said:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"The traditions of the Neapolitan government are hereditary perjury.
The new king, almost to prove the legitimacy of his descent, is
preparing to perjure himself; and, in order to qualify himself for the
task of forswearing himself, he must first swear. It is with that view
that he declares himself ready to swear constitutions and alliances.
His object in proposing an alliance with the king's government
is obvious. He is only meditating the reconquest of Sicily. These
are the old fox-like wiles of the Neapolitan government. As these
have thrice availed them, they hope, even now, from the same arts,
to attain the same results. But if these are very clearly the intentions
of the government of Naples, there is also no doubt but the
<a id='Page_356'></a>government of the king—of that king who for the last twelve years
has held aloft the banner of Italian nationality, will never desert his
post, never will associate itself with a faith-breaking government, a
government by the nature of its very institutions an implacable foe to
Italian regeneration."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>The following is an extract from the letter of an English
lady in Florence:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"The details that have reached here, through both private and public
information, of the horrible sufferings endured by the Sicilians, are
enough to account for the fiendish hatred excited by the Neapolitans,
whose conduct to the unfortunate islanders is almost a repetition of the
frightful barbarities of the Indians during the late war, for neither
sex, age, nor innocence, are any protection against the perpetration
of the most awful atrocities. It is beyond belief that, in the
nineteenth century, in a Christian part of Europe, there have been
scenes enacted within the last few months that renew the days of the
Inquisition. A gentleman, residing in Florence, has received
intelligence of his family in Sicily, giving details of the sufferings
of his brother, who was subjected to a 'torture' that even surpassed all
the refined cruelty that was ever imagined by Ximenes and his
inquisitorial establishment, having been chained to a copper chair,
under the seat of which was lighted a charcoal fire! This is only one of
the many incidents that have taken place—incidents that make the cheek
grow pale, even to hear of. No wonder there has been such a burst of
enthusiasm throughout all Europe for Garibaldi and his noble expedition.
Every civilized land has echoed the bell which has been tolled in Italy
for the annihilation of despotism. There has not been raised one
sympathetic voice to cry to Francis of Naples, 'Hear it not Duncan, for
it summons thee' to join the circle of deposed tyrants that have sought
asylums within such short distances of each other, imitating the
instinct of the featherly tribe, who only seek society with companions
of the same color."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>The feelings of the people of Naples cannot be imagined,
without some knowledge of the cruelties of the government.
The following shocking account of the cruelty practised on a
man who was called an American, by the priests of Rome
and Italy, is from a letter written in Naples, just after the
revolution, by a person who saw him and obtained from him
since his own story:</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_357'></a>
<h3 class='c032'><b>BARBAROUS TREATMENT OF A POLITICAL PRISONER.</b></h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Amongst the many cases of brutal and illegal imprisonment
which have been brought before the public during the last ten days,
none has been worse than that of Francisco Casanova, <i>calling himself
an American</i>. He was confined in San Francisco, and some young
men who had formerly been placed in the same prison, though not in
the same room, remembering his case, went, on the amnesty being
proclaimed, to deliver him; but he was all but naked, and he could
not leave until an advocate called Arene, who has acted with great
benevolence, sent him some clothes, and has since received him in
his house and fed him. Last night I went to see him, and I cannot
tell you whether indignation against this most Christian government
or compassion for the victim was the strongest feeling. 'When he
entered my house,' said Arene, 'he was supported by two persons,
for he was unable to walk. He looked like a ghost.' 'Where am
I?' he exclaimed, as he looked confusedly around; and well he
might, after six years and a half of confinement from all intercourse
with man. But I give you his own description of his sufferings, as
nearly as possible in his own words, premising merely that there were
witnesses of all that I relate, in Arene himself, a Neapolitan friend,
and a foreign consul.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"I landed in Genoa from Boston some time in 1853, and wishing
to see the south of Italy, travelled till I came near to Viterbo, when I
was cautioned not to go to Rome; but I still persevered in my intention
of doing so, when I was arrested as not having a passport, and
carried to the Eternal City, where I was placed in the Carcere Nuova.
Not satisfied with the report I gave of myself, I was tortured for three
months as follows. My hands and arms were bound together, and
then, by ropes tied round the upper part of the arms, they were
drawn back till my breast protruded, and my bones sounded, 'crick,
crick.' There was another species of torture practised upon me,
which was this: At night, whilst sleeping, the door was secretly
opened, and buckets of water were thrown over my body. How I
survived it I cannot tell; the keepers were astonished, and said they
never had such an instance; 'but you will never get out alive,' I was
told. I replied that I never expected to do so, and prayed for the
angel of death to come. The worst torture of all, however, was the
prison itself—a room into which a few rays of light struggled from
above, and the stench of which was as bad as death. For three
months I suffered thus, and then, without any reason assigned, was
taken from it and placed, always alone, in a room called 'Salon del
<a id='Page_358'></a>Preti,' a large airy room, and was well fed and well treated for
twenty-one months more. I was a prisoner of the Cardinal Secretary
Antonelli. About the middle of 1855 again, without any reason
being given, I was sent off to Naples, was placed first in the Vicaria
and afterward in San Francisco, in a small, close room, where I was
detained for four years and a half. I was questioned on several
occasions, and at last refused to answer, saying that my persecutors
already knew what I had to say, that I was unjustly and illegally
confined, and nothing could compel me to utter another word. On
another occasion I was called before Bianchini, the director of police,
who interrogated me. I appealed against my sufferings, and all the
reply I received was, 'Va bene, va bene,' from a Christian man to
one suffering as I was, but my invariable answer was, I will die first;
never will I ask anything of this government. When first I arrived
here I had a little money, which for a short time procured me better
food than prison fare, and then by degrees I sold my clothes. At
last I sold my black bread to have a little salt to sprinkle over my
beans, and sometimes to procure some incense to relieve the horrid
stench of my prison. As for water for purposes of cleanliness, it was
never supplied me, and all that I could do, was to dip one of my own
rags in a jug of drinking water, and wash some portions of my body.
During the day I could repose, but at night I was covered with black
beetles, fleas, lice, and every conceivable species of vermin. I
expected death, and desired and prayed for it as a relief, but it never
came. My clothes were at last so reduced, that I was all but naked,
and so I have passed four summers and winters, pacing up and down
my narrow chamber.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"'I will show you my prison-dress,' said he; and going out,
returned in a few moments. He might have stood as a model for
Lazarus risen from the tomb. The lower part of his body was
covered with a thin pair of linen drawers, nothing more. On his feet
was a pair of shoes, with soles and upper leather all in holes. He
had no shirt, but over the upper part of his body, was thrown a rag,
something like a common kitchen-towel, one corner of which he had
placed on his head, as the long elfin locks which had not been cut,
for many years hung down over his neck and shoulders. He appeared
more like a brute than a Christian man. 'See this rag,' said he,
'how I have botched it. This was my dress, and so clad, I paced up
and down my solitary den.'</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"There is much that Casanova reports of himself that I do not
repeat, for it is so mysterious that I require further evidence of its
correctness. There can, however, be no doubt of his sufferings and
<a id='Page_359'></a>imprisonment in Naples. It has long been whispered about here
that an unknown individual was lying in the prisons of San Francisco,
but nothing was known of him. He was one of the mysteries of the
dungeon, and even now there is much to unravel. Who is he?—what
secret motives led to his double confinement here and in
Rome?—why was he transferred from the hands of a Christian cardinal
to the mercies of De Spagnoli? What he said I report, and time
must unravel his story; but the world will know how to appreciate
the influence of a priesthood under whose eye such enormities have
been committed."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>In Naples, on the 26th of June, assemblages of the population
commenced. The populace shouted "<span class='sc'>Garibaldi</span> forever!"
"Annexation forever!" "Death to the police!"
The following day a panic took place; the police were maltreated,
and disappeared as soon as the same cries were
raised by the populace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king had twice sent Signor Aquila to Baron Brenier,
and had promised to make a strict investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 28th of June all the police stations were pillaged
in open day; forty of the agents were surprised, and either
killed or wounded. The archives were burnt. The spoils
were carried about in triumph by the populace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king had arrived at Naples, and had ordered the
immediate formation of a national guard.</p>

<p class='c007'>A proclamation was issued, prohibiting seditious shouts,
and recommending the military to disperse assemblages of the
population with moderation.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the successes of Garibaldi in Calabria became known
in the city of Naples, and his unimpeded advance toward
that capital, the excitement daily increased. A letter, dated
there on the 5th of September, said:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Seven-league boots must be in fashion again, and Garibaldi must
have a pair. It was but yesterday he was at Faro; then we find him
at Pezzo, Tiriola, Nicastro, Paolo, until, by a series of gigantic
strides, by last reports he was at Campagna, the capital of one of the
four districts of Salerno. I shall expect at any hour to meet the
great dictator in the Toledo. His march has been a continual triumph—war
<a id='Page_360'></a>in its severer aspects he has not seen in the kingdom of Naples,
but wreathed with flowers scattering confections and weeping tears
of welcome and joy. Apart from a hatred of the Bourbons, Garibaldi
is worshipped as a demi-god, and I believe that the veriest
reactionist in the kingdom would sheathe his sword to look at him.
It is hero-worship which has smoothed the passage of the dictator
rather than anything more definite or settled in principle."</span></p>

<p class='c006'>The priests, the same letter declared, were much connected
with the two last revolutionary attempts:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"For that of Prince Luigi (Count of Aquila), the vicars of some
parishes, just before the outbreak was to have occurred, placarded
the doors of the houses of their faithful followers with little bills,
one of which is in my possession, bearing this inscription:</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>"'Viva Jesu Christo!</div>
      <div class='line'>Viva la Madonna Immacolata!</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Viva San Francesco!'</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"This was to protect those houses.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Naples is in a state of the greatest excitement. It is one great
heart without a head, and the most singular contrasts present themselves
at every step. I left a scene of wild confusion in the Toledo
late last night, when the names only of Garibaldi and Victor Emanuel
were heard, and, going down to Santa Lucia, I found every house
illuminated, torches burning, and fagots borne by a crowd of rabble,
a small bell tinkling, and a priest bearing the host, surrounded by
hundreds of devotees. They stop, and the vast crowd fall upon their
knees. Silence! not a sound was heard, except the indistinct roar
of voices from the Toledo. On the walls close behind were the cannon
of the Bourbons, and in the offing the fleets of many nations, all
brought out as distinctly as possible by the gorgeous moonlight of
our southern sky. What a host of conflicting ideas were here
brought into juxtaposition and contrast!</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Last night it was decided that the king should leave immediately;
at midnight it was deferred, but <i>only</i> deferred. The throne has
well nigh fallen."</span></p>

the country. Such, in fact, is the speculative and practical principle
which in Naples animates the Union Ecclesiastical Committee
in order to arrive at the most holy object of independence, in the
noble undertaking of Italian redemption. For these reasons the
committee are intent on the union of ideas with facts; they profess
it to be their indispensable duty to labor unweariedly, so as not to go
in opposition to the orthodox faith, which rests in Christ and his
vicar on earth—in Christ as God-man, in his vicar as the first religious
and the first civil power of the world. Hence, taking its stand on
these axioms, the committee declares its intention of realizing the
evangelical maxim that spiritually the state is in the church, as
temporarily the church is in the state; and so it labors to establish
the unity of Italy in the order of religion and civilization; in the
order of religion, of which the pontiff of Rome is the œcumenical
moderator; in the order of civilization, of which Victor Emanuel is
the only regulator in the Italian kingdom."</span></p>

<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>THE CONDITION OF NAPLES SINCE THE REIGN OF TERROR
IN APRIL—AGITATION ON GARIBALDI'S APPROACH.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a reign of terror in Naples in April, 1860, in
consequence of numerous arrests and imprisonments of persons
of all classes, many of them on the merest suspicion.
The British minister in that city, who had repeatedly distinguished
himself by his humane exposure and protest
against the cruelties of the old savage, Bomba, now made
new representations to his government, that these measures
were taken by the Intendants in compliance with a circular
from the Minister of Police. On the 1st of March they
arrested numbers who were not suspected at all, and among
them several dukes, marquises, counts, and princes. Other
evidences were given by the government of their great fear
of an insurrection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is from the letter addressed to the King of
Naples by the Count of Syracuse:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Civil war, which is already spreading over the provinces of the
continent, will carry away the dynasty into that ultimate ruin which
the iniquitous arts of perverse advisers have long been preparing for
the descendants of Charles III. of Bourbon; the blood of the citizens,
uselessly spilt, will again flood the thousand towns of the kingdom,
and you, once the hope and love of the people, will be regarded with
horror as the sole cause of a fratricidal war.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Sire, while it is yet time, save our house from the curses of all
Italy! Follow the noble example of our royal kinswoman of Parma,
who, on the breaking out of civil war, released her subjects from their
<a id='Page_363'></a>allegiance, and left them to be arbiters of their own destinies. Europe
and your subjects will take your sublime sacrifice into account,
and you, sire, will be able to raise your brow in confidence up to
God, who will reward the magnanimous act of your majesty. Your
heart, tempered by adversity, will become accessible to the noble
aspirations of patriotism, and you will bless the day when you
generously sacrificed yourself for the greatness of Italy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"With these words, sire, I fulfill the sacred duty which my experience
imposes upon me, and I pray to God that he may enlighten
you, and render you deserving of His blessings.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>"<span class='sc'>Naples</span>, <i>Aug. 24</i>."</p>
<p class='c006'>In the latter part of August, reports of the nearer approach
of Garibaldi, and of risings in different parts of the
country, were multiplied daily; and the secret patriotic committee
more openly and freely circulated their publications,
which were to be seen in every house. Movements had been
made, before the 25th, in Matera, the Capitanata, Bari,
Monopolo, and Sassinoro, and in Potenza and Corleta provisional
governments were formed in favor of Victor
Emanuel. Indeed, the kingdom was in a state of general
revolution, and a pro-dictatorial committee held its sessions
to direct "the great Lucanian insurrection." An order was
also published in Naples, in the name of Garibaldi, Dictator
of the Two Sicilies, providing that all authorities should remain
at their posts; that acts of the government should be
published in the name of Victor Emanuel; that a committee
of public security and a commission of engineers should be
formed to barricade the city; and that all capable of bearing
arms should join the National Guard. Committees were
also formed for looking after the commissariat, and attending
to the sick and wounded, on which committee were the
names of seven ecclesiastics. The headquarters of the insurrectionists
were at Potenza, in the province of Basilicata,
and to this point were crowding hundreds and thousands of
volunteers. The people of the country itself had taken up
<a id='Page_364'></a>arms. All business was suspended; one thought alone occupied
the public mind. The great fear of many was of pillage;
and the want of occupation, and the almost general
famine among the lower classes, gave such a fear yet greater
appearance of reasonableness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The landing of several detachments of the Garibaldians
was now a confirmed fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following account of the revolution in the Basilicata
will afford an idea of the changes then made in the country:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"The province of Basilicata had long been agitated; it is a mountainous
country, subject to earthquakes. The war of Italy, the adventures
of Garibaldi, the constitution of Francis II., precipitated the crisis.
The reactionary attempts at Matera gave the signal for the movement.
Potenza, the chief town of the province, was only defended by gendarmes.
They were apparently on good terms with the national
guard, and their chief, Captain Castagna, had given his word of honor
that he would not be the first to commence the attack.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"On the morning of the 18th of October, the gendarmes formed in
column, left the town, and took up a position within musket shot of
the houses on the Monte. Castagna removed his men in this way to
tranquillize the country, as he said. However, a picket of national
guards at the Salsa gate watched the movements of the gendarmes.
It was well they did, for Captain Castagna all at once returned with
his men at double-quick pace, dividing them into two columns, one of
which was to attack the post held by the national guard, and the
other to open the prisons.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The first discharge of the royalists took place before the men
attacked had time to cry 'To arms!' A bullet struck Captain Asselta
in the temple. He had firmly stood the charge with some fifty of the
national guardsmen. Not till then did the latter open fire, and the
gendarmes were put to flight. They disbanded about the town and
the open country, striking at random, pursued and hunted everywhere
by the peasants, who were armed with hatchets. They also lost some
fifty prisoners: about fifty were wounded, and more than twenty
slain.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Besides the wound of Captain Asselta, the insurgents had to deplore
the loss of two young men, and count both women and children
among the wounded. Nevertheless, this strange insurrection, provoked,
hastened at least, and justified like the Italian war of last year,
by the attack of the gendarmes, was entirely successful, and it spread
<a id='Page_365'></a>most rapidly. Clouds of armed mountaineers came down from all
parts of the heights to help their brethren in the town. The wounded
and royal prisoners were not only spared, at the simple command of a
chief, but received every assistance, just as if they had been fighting
for the good cause.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"On the 19th, at Tito, the national guard drove out the gendarmes;
on the 20th there were more than 10,000 armed men at Potenza; on
the 22d 16,000 were mustered. All the nobility, the landowners, the
chief inhabitants, the educated citizens, even the priests, were on the
side of the insurgents. The peasants took up arms spontaneously to
the cry of 'Long live Victor Emanuel.' The cross of Savoy floated
everywhere on the tri-color flag. The forces were commanded by a
Neapolitan, who had already figured in two former Italian wars—Colonel
Boldoni.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>Strong detachments were stationed <i>en échelons</i> around the town
and upon the mountains. Good positions were occupied, amongst
others that of Marmo, whence a handful of men can keep in check an
army, and renew the defence of Mazagran. The insurrection assumed such
proportions that it kept the royal forces at a distance. Neapolitans
and Bavarians had been sent against it; the former stopped at
Auletta, the latter at Salerno.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Potenza was barricaded, and preparing to resist to the death. It
had already a provisional government, whose two first acts the
National Committee published, headed:</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Rumors of the defection of the king's officers were repeated every
moment. It was asserted in Naples that General Nunziante had
just gone over to Garibaldi. The Duchess of Mignano, the wife of the
exiled general, having been ordered to quit Naples, proudly refused
to go, and defied the ministers to remove her by force."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>During a few days about the beginning of September, the
king's ministers, his army and the city, were in a state of the
greatest agitation. On the 3d, General Cotrufiano sent in
his resignation, but expressed his hope that the ministry
would remain in power. The National Guard, who had
before communicated with them, then told them that if they
did not remain they would commence the revolution in the
city.</p>

<p class='c007'>As circumstances, however, were, the ministers considered
it impossible to remain with dignity or advantage to the
country, and, <i>en masse</i>, again sent in their written resignation.
"We have been called traitors," they said. "We have the
troops against us, and no longer enjoy the confidence of the
sovereign; we are supported by the National Guard and the
people, it is true, and are their ministers rather than the
king's; but this is not according to the principles of the
Constitution, and we therefore earnestly beg your majesty
to choose a transition ministry. Besides, we will not undertake
the responsibility of the war against Garibaldi and his
followers, for it will be altogether useless." Such, remarks
a writer who was at that time in Naples, was the manner
in which the ministers addressed his majesty, and put into
plain English, it means this: "<i>If your majesty will abandon
all self-defence, we will serve you, but if you are determined to
risk an action, we will persist in resigning, and then barricades
will be formed directly.</i>" The choice left to Francis II., then,
<a id='Page_367'></a>was revolution or abdication, and this is the end of that vast
structure of despotism which Ferdinand II. reared with so
much labor, and cemented with so much blood. On Sunday
morning, the ministers met in the council chamber, and waited
for some decision on the part of his majesty, but none came;
but later in the day, De Martino was sent for by the king,
and requested to form an administration. This, however,
De Martino declined doing, and the king exclaimed, in great
sadness, "Then I am abandoned by all." So stood the
matter on Sunday night. It was clear that the ministers
had no hopes or intentions, even if they remained in power,
of doing anything more than keep things together till Garibaldi
came. To them, as to all in Naples, it was evident
enough that the game was up, and that all they could do
for the country was to make the fall, or transition, as easy
as possible. Up to that time their conduct was beyond all
praise. There was an impression in the city that the ministerial
difficulties had been arranged, and, in consequence,
on Saturday and Sunday night there was a partial illumination
of the city, and bills were placarded bearing the inscription,
"<i>Viva Garibaldi!</i>" "<i>Viva Romano!</i>"—the chief
minister.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible for any generous mind to contemplate the
position of Francis II. without compassion. Not gifted by
nature with much intelligence, kept in gross ignorance, and
reared in a school of political despotism and religious bigotry
by his father, misguided and betrayed by evil counsellors in
the early part of his reign, and finally abandoned by his oldest
uncle, and by the contemptible nobility and parasites who
supported or tolerated the corruptions of the government so
long as they were to their own advantage, he sat alone in
his palace, the last sovereign of his family, hesitating as to
the moment when he is to lay down both crown and sceptre.
Close to his palace crowds were reading and rejoicing in the
latest dispatches from the camp of the enemy, who was advancing
by rapid marches—an enemy whom he had no force
<a id='Page_368'></a>to repel; and not much more distant resided the minister of
a sovereign who subscribed himself the "beloved cousin"
(or by some similar hypocrisy) of Francis II., at the same
time that he was doing all that in him lay to drive him from
the throne. The position was a hard one, created by the
Bourbons themselves—a fulfillment of the great decree, that
the sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a contrast was then presented between the cold,
bloody cruelty of the Bourbons and the noble moderation of
this long oppressed people! Thousands in the city had in
some form or other been victims of revenge or suspicion; and
it is truly wonderful that not a hand, nor even a voice, was
raised against the unprotected king.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for placing himself at the head of the army, his majesty
had no army to command. During the whole of Sunday
night, boats were going backward and forward between the
land and the Spanish vessels with royal property. The
queen mother was already in Albano, near Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was in the bay a most imposing fleet, representing
every nation in Europe. Even the Pope had his flag lying
off the Villa. On that side of the city there were fourteen
vessels of war, and as many off Santa Lucia.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>FLIGHT OF THE KING OF NAPLES.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"At 6 o'clock in the evening of September, his majesty went on
board a Spanish vessel, and at 8 o'clock left Neapolitan waters.
Before leaving, his majesty published his protest, which is given
below.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"It would appear that the French admiral thought, with the prefect,
that some precautions were necessary, and he therefore called on the
British Admiral Mundy in the course of the evening, and announced
his intention of sending some men on shore. Admiral M. replied that
he saw no necessity for the step, as the city was perfectly tranquil."</span></p>

<h3 class='c032'><b>PROTEST OF FRANCIS II.</b></h3>

<p class='c019'><span class='small'>"Since a reckless adventurer, possessing all the force of which
revolutionary Europe can dispose, has attacked our dominions, under
<a id='Page_369'></a>the name of an Italian sovereign who is both a relation and a friend,
we have striven for five months long, with all the means in our power,
on behalf of the sacred independence of our states.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The fortune of war has proved contrary to us. The reckless enterprise
of which the above sovereign protested his ignorance in the
most formal manner, and which, nevertheless, at the moment when
negotiations were going on for an intimate alliance between us,
received in his own states its principal support and assistance, that
enterprise at which the whole of Europe assisted with indifference,
after having proclaimed the principle of non-intervention, leaving us
alone to fight against the common enemy, is now upon the point of
extending its disastrous effects to our own capital. The forces of the
enemy are now approaching this neighborhood.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"On the other hand, both Sicily and the provinces of the continent,
which for a long time have been agitated in every manner by a
revolution, rising in insurrection under so great an excitement, have
formed provisional governments under the title and nominal protection
of the above sovereign, and have confided to a pretended dictator
full authority and the decision of their destiny.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Strong in our rights, founded upon history, in international treaty,
and in the public law of Europe, we intend to prolong our defence,
while it is possible; yet we are no less determined upon every
sacrifice in order to save this vast metropolis, the glorious home of
the most ancient memories, the birthplace of national art and
civilization, from the horrors of anarchy and civil war.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"In consequence, we shall retire beyond the walls with our army,
confiding in the loyalty and the love of our subjects for the
preservation of order and for respect being shown to authority.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"In taking this determination we are conscious of a duty which
our ancient and uncontested rights, our honor, the interest of our
heirs and successors, and more than all, the welfare of our most beloved
subjects, have imposed upon us, and therefore we protest loudly
against all acts which have been accomplished up to this time, and
against the events which are on the point of completion, or which
may be accomplished in future. We reserve, then, all our rights and
privileges, arising from the most sacred and incontestable laws of
succession as well as from the force of treaties, and we declare
solemnly that all the aforesaid acts and events are null, void, and of
no effect. For what concerns us we leave our cause, and the cause of
our people, in the hands of Almighty God, under the firm conviction that
during the short space of our reign we have not entertained a single
thought that was not devoted to the happiness and the good of our
<a id='Page_370'></a>subjects. The institutions which we have irrevocably guaranteed are
the proof of this.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"This protest of ours will be transmitted to every court, and we
desire that, signed by us, provided with the seal of our royal arms, and
countersigned by our minister of foreign affairs, it should be preserved
in our royal offices of the exterior, of the privy council and of
grace of justice, as a record of our firm resolution always to oppose
reason and right to violence and usurpation.</span></p>

are the grandest and the most solemn, and I intend to
fulfill them with resignation, free from weakness, and with a serene
and confident heart, as befits the descendants of so many monarchs.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"For such a purpose I once more address my voice to the
people of this metropolis, from whom I am now to depart with bitter
grief.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"An unjust war, carried on in contravention to the law of nations,
has invaded my states, notwithstanding the fact that I was at peace
with all the European powers.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The changed order of government, and my adhesion to the great
principles of Italian nationality, were not sufficient to ward off the
war; and, moreover, the necessity of defending the integrity of the
state entailed upon me the obligations of events which I have always
deplored; therefore, I solemnly protest against this indescribable
hostility, concerning which the present and future time will pronounce
their solemn verdict.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The diplomatic corps residing at my court has known since the
commencement of this unexpected invasion, with what sentiments my
heart has been filled for all my people, as well as for this illustrious
city, with a view of securing her from ruin and war, of saving her
inhabitants and all their property, her sacred churches, her monuments,
her public buildings, her collection of art, and all that which
forms the patrimony of her civilization and of her greatness, and
which being an inheritance of future generations, is superior to the
passions of a day.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The time has now come to fulfill these professions of mine. The
<a id='Page_371'></a>war is now approaching the walls of the city, and with unutterable
grief I am now to depart with a portion of my army to betake myself
whither the defence of my rights calls me. The remainder of my
army remains in company with the honorable national guard, in
order to protect the inviolability and safety of the capitol, which I
recommend as a sacred treasure to the zeal of the ministry; and I
call upon the honor and the civic feeling of the mayor of Naples and
of the commandant of the said national guard, to spare this most
beloved country of mine the horrors of internal discord and the
disasters of civil war; for which purpose I concede to the above-named
the widest powers that they may require.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"As a descendant of a dynasty that has reigned over this continent
for 126 years, after having preserved it from the horrors of a long
vice-royalty, the affections of my heart are here. I am a Neapolitan,
nor could I without bitter grief address words of farewell to my most
dearly beloved people, to my fellow citizens. Whatever may be my
destiny, be it prosperous or adverse, I shall always preserve for them
a passionate and affectionate remembrance. I recommend to them
concord, peace, and a strict observance of their civic duties. Let not
an excessive zeal for my dynasty be made a pretence for disturbance.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Whether from the fortunes of the present war I return shortly

<div class='c011'>"<span class='sc'>Francis II.</span>"</div>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE LATE KING OF NAPLES DESCRIBED BY HIMSELF.</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>A late number of the "Revue de Paris" publishes a
curious correspondence between Louis Philippe and Ferdinand
II., the late King of Naples. Shortly after the revolution
of July, Louis Philippe addressed a letter to Ferdinand
II., advising him in the government of his kingdom, to
relinquish a little so that all might not be lost, to give up his
system of compression and severity. "Imitate," said Louis
Philippe, "the system in France; you will be a gainer in
every respect; for, by sacrificing a little authority, you will
insure peace to your kingdom and stability to your house.
<a id='Page_372'></a>The symptoms of agitation are so strongly pronounced and
numerous in Italy, that an outbreak may be expected sooner
or later, accordingly as the stern measures of Prince Metternich
may hasten or adjourn it. Your majesty will be drawn
into the current if you are not prepared to stem the tide, and
your house will be burst in two, either by the revolutionary
stream or by the measures of repression the Vienna Cabinet
may think fit to adopt. Your majesty may save everything
by anticipating voluntarily and with prudence the wishes and
wants of your people."</p>

<p class='c007'>To this excellent advice and very remarkable counsel,
coming as it did from a Bourbon, Ferdinand II. returned the
following answer:</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"To imitate France, if ever France can be imitated, I shall have
to precipitate myself into that policy of Jacobinism, for which my
people has proved feloniously guilty more than once against the house
of its kings. Liberty is fatal to the house of Bourbon; and, as
regards myself, I am resolved to avoid, at all price, the fate of Louis
XVI. and Charles X. My people obey force and bend their necks,
but woe's me should they ever raise them under the impulse of those
dreams which sound so fine in the sermons of philosophers, and
which are impossible in practice. With God's blessing, I will give
prosperity to my people, and a government as honest as they have a
right to; but I will be king, and always. My people do not want to
think; I take upon myself the care of their welfare and their dignity.
I have inherited many old grudges, many mad desires, arising from
all the faults and weaknesses of the past; I must set this to rights,
and I can only do so by drawing closer to Austria without subjecting
myself to her will. We are not of this century. The Bourbons are
ancient, and if they were to try to shape themselves according to the
pattern of the new dynasties, they would be ridiculous. We will imitate
the Hapsburgs. If fortune plays us false, we shall at least be
true to ourselves. Nevertheless, your majesty may rely upon my
lively sympathy and my warmest wishes that you may succeed in
mastering that ungovernable people who make France the curse of
Europe."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>Here it was well remarked by a writer:</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"We have the father of Francis II. exactly as he was, and
exactly as his son has been after him. Out of the lips of the Bourbon
<a id='Page_373'></a>it is proved that a Garibaldi was sadly wanted in Sicily. Well, the
Garibaldi has come, and the necks of the people bend no more; the
people have begun to have a desire to 'think;' have raised their
necks 'under the impulse of those dreams which sound so fine in the
sermons of philosophers,' and the 'woe's me,' which the Bourbon
Ferdinand II. feared would fall upon him when the people did so rise,
has fallen upon the head of the Bourbon Francis II. 'The Bourbons
are very ancient,' said Ferdinand, 'and if they were to try to shape
themselves according to the pattern of the new dynasties, they would
be ridiculous.' Well, Francis II., penned up there in Gaeta, with a
very small pattern of an army, strikes us as a very ridiculous king,
and ridiculous because he did not shape himself according to the
pattern of a wise and liberal monarch. This letter of Ferdinand II.
is one of the most striking lessons of history that the present century
has afforded."</span></p>

—ENTERS NAPLES—ENTHUSIASM AND GOOD ORDER OF THE
PEOPLE—THE NEW GOVERNMENT—THE ARMY AND NAVY—VARIOUS
OCCURRENCES.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Garibaldi</span>, after his wonderful triumph over the royal army
in Calabria, made rapid marches through the wild regions
of that part of the peninsula toward Naples. By rising
early, pressing on and resting but little, he performed a
journey of about two hundred and eighty miles to Salerno,
in a fortnight from the day of his landing at Reggio.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Garibaldi's entry into Naples, the Sardinian admiral
had threatened to fire upon any Neapolitan vessel which
should attempt to proceed to Gaeta.</p>

<p class='c007'>A <i>Te Deum</i> had been celebrated in the cathedral by
Father Gavazzi, the people shouting "Hurrah for Victor
Emanuel!" "Hurrah for Garibaldi!" The people were
armed, some even with pikes and sticks.</p>

<p class='c007'>General illuminations had taken place. The Papal Nuncio,
a great part of the ambassadors, and Count Trapani,
had followed the king to Gaeta. The king had appointed
Signor Ulloa, brother of General Ulloa, as his prime minister,
and had issued a proclamation.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the morning of the 7th of September, Garibaldi was
at Salerno, a town near the southern extremity of the vast
and splendid bay of Naples, and about thirty miles distant
<a id='Page_375'></a>from the capital, preparing to proceed to it by the railroad.
The love with which he attaches his friends to him was evident,
in the manner in which his personal staff clung to him
at the station. Very few accompanied him; but 25,000
troops were to follow him in four days.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following account of Garibaldi in Salerno, is from a
letter of Mr. Edwin James to a friend:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"The long roll of the 'spirit-stirring drums,' the discordant noises
of the Calabrese soldiers as they were endeavoring to form their
ranks, the dashing in of carriages from Naples with their cargoes of
deputations to attend Garibaldi, roused me before four o'clock,
September 7th, from my bed, in a wretched 'albergo' in Salerno, where
I had been the prey of mosquitoes since midnight. Garibaldi was
astir as early as four o'clock; he had seen members of the committee
from Naples, and was arranging his <i>entrée</i> into the city. At my
interview with him yesterday at Eboli, which was a hurried one, he
had requested me to see him in the evening; he was so surrounded
by crowds of admirers, all anxious for a glimpse at the 'great man,'
that I delayed my interview until this morning. On entering the
large rooms of the Hôtel de Ville, or 'Intendenza,' the throngs of
people and their agitation and excitement were most striking.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The national guard of Salerno lined the avenues; priests of
every denomination crowded to touch the 'hem of his garment.'
Officers of State of the king were in earnest conversation with him,
urging his coming without delay into Naples.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"A special train of about 20 carriages was in waiting at 10 o'clock,
and we obtained a seat in the carriage next to that in which Garibaldi
was. Throughout the journey to Naples, in every village, at every
station, the joy and enthusiasm of the people exceeded the powers
of description. Women and girls presented flags, threw flowers into
the carriages, struggled to kiss the hand of the general. Mayors
and syndics ejaculated their gratulations; priests and monks stood,
surrounded by their wretched flocks, on the hill-side, and shouted
their 'Vivas,' and holding the crucifix in one hand and the sword in
the other, waved them in the air, and bawled out their benedictions.
As the train passed the king's guard at Portici, the soldiers threw
their caps into the air, and joined lustily in the 'Viva Garibaldi!'"</span></p>

<p class='c007'>It was reported in Naples, about eleven o'clock, that
Garibaldi was to arrive that day, and a great part of the
<a id='Page_376'></a>inhabitants, on first hearing the news, hastened to the station.
A detachment of national guards marched with the
national colors flying, and in the yard assembled all the
leading liberals in their carriages, the secret committee, now
no longer concealed, and several foreign ministers, including
the French, M. Brenier, to do honor to the hero.</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Many ladies were in the waiting-saloon, which was crowded with
national guards and gentlemen in plain clothes and all sorts of
uniforms.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"After waiting an hour (writes a spectator), shouts were heard,
and the scream of an arriving train. 'He is come!' The train
steams in. In the first carriage, standing on the roof, is a giant of a
man, with a cap, a red shirt, and the handkerchief fastened on his
shoulders. The cries and cheers increase. Suddenly all is hushed
again, and we are down to zero. It is only a train of disarmed Bavarians
en route from Salerno. At last he does come. The enthusiasm
is overpowering. Surrounded by a band of soldiers, sons of Anak as
to size, and dressed in the wild and travel-stained costumes of an
irregular army on a campaign, comes Garibaldi. The first thing that
strikes you is his face, and the deep determination of his extraordinary
forehead. A face that might serve as a model for the sculptor,
is softened almost to sweetness by the mildness of the eyes and the
low tone of the most musical voice I have ever heard. Long, grizzly
curls hang from his broad hat. He wears a red shirt with a silk
handkerchief on his shoulders, like the 'panuelo' of the South American,
and grey trousers. He escapes as well and as soon as he can from a
reception, which he accepts rather than covets, and proceeds to take
possession of his new abode.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi entered the private carriage of the French minister, his
staff following in other carriages, and some few on horseback; the
cortége consisted of about twenty vehicles. Individually I have never
seen such men as his body-guard, and the picturesque dress sets off
their height and the squareness of their build. Compared with these
soldiers, Garibaldi is short, but very powerfully made. Along the
crowded Marinelli, the headquarters of lazzaroni, now constitutional
popolani, one of whom rode before Garibaldi's carriage, through the
Largo del Castello, the Strada di Toledo, and finally to the Palazzo
della Regina di Savoia, opposite the Palazzo Reale, which the dictator
refused to inhabit, the cortége makes its way, and Garibaldi enters
into what was once a palace of the Bourbons. The shouts of the
<a id='Page_377'></a>crowd now gathered together in the square penetrate the inmost recesses,
and presently the window opens and Garibaldi appears, followed
by a large staff of officials. The others stop, and he advances
alone to the centre of the balcony that extends along the palace, and
the cheering is deafening. It is no use for the hero to speak till the
people have a little exhausted their powers; so he stands there alone,
leaning on his hand, with his fine features in repose, and an almost
melancholy expression on his face, as if he felt that his career was a
duty which had its thorns as well as its roses; and that, though the
end sanctifies the means, yet carnage and slaughter, tottering thrones
and crumbling dynasties, leave their impression on the brow that
caused them. I have never seen so grand a study as Garibaldi, as he
stood silently speculating, perhaps, over the true value of the people
whom he had just freed. He spoke at some length, but it was impossible
to distinguish what he said, though it was easy to perceive that
he speaks with great energy. Having satisfied, for the moment at least,
the desires of the bassa-gente (the populace), it was time to re-enter
the palace and receive the welcome of the upper classes. The stair
and entrée to the dictator's levée were an extraordinary spectacle.
The door leading to the suite of apartments in which the general
held his reception was kept by the national guard, who were perpetually
assailed by persons desiring to see the dictator 'face to face.'
Men of all nations and in all costumes seemed suddenly to have
started up in the heart of Naples.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The reception was brief—even Garibaldi requires repose—and
after having appeared on both sides of the palace, and received the
compliments of all classes, including a Venetian deputy, who said,
'We are ready, and only await Garibaldi,' to which the dictator replied,
with a quiet smile, 'Aspetta, aspetta!' (Wait, wait), he retired from
the palazzo to his quarters in the Palazzo Angri, Strada Toledo, where
another ovation awaited him. On his way he went to the cathedral, and
was received with due honors. The generality of priests have retired
to their cells, but many are still about, and I met one in the presence
chambers in full canonicals, crossed by a tri-colored scarf, and
bearing an enormous Sardinian flag—'<i>Tempora mutantur et nos.</i>'"</span></p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday, the 8th, there was a sudden commotion in
the Castelnovo, on the shore, a description of which will
convey a just idea of the state of Naples and the garrison.
A spectator wrote:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"One of those uproarious bursts of applause which come upon us
<a id='Page_378'></a>like hurricanes, called me to the window. The soldiers in the garrison
at the Castelnovo had just burst out, and were running, jumping,
galloping past my house like so many slaves who had burst out of the
house of bondage. Some were armed with muskets; most had their
sacks full of loaves of bread, which dropped from their wallets as they
ran along, shouting, like so many madmen, 'Viva Garibaldi!' At
every step they met with crowds of men and women, armed with
naked swords, daggers, and pikes, which they flourished in the air,
uttering at the same time the usual magic cries. Dirty-looking
fellows, in the Neapolitan uniform, were hugged and kissed by
persons as dirty as themselves, and then uniting, all surged onward
to the Toledo. It was impossible to remain in the house,
and escaping from my chains, which fell from me as soon as the
post left, I hurried into the street. I turn round to Criatamone,
and just above me, peering over the walls, I see a number of soldiers
in garrison in the Pizzofalcone, and watching if the road was
clear. The people about me were waving their hands to them, and
inviting them to come down. There are iron doors at the bottom,
and sentinels stand by them. Down come the troops in a torrent—sentinels
are motionless, the doors bend, at last yield, and at length
out they come like so many madmen out of Bedlam, and run after
their companions from the Castelnovo. Sentinels still stand, 'pro
formâ,' at the doors of both the forts, but they are abandoned, and
empty walls and harmless cannon alone remain to be guarded.
Meanwhile, Garibaldi is going to Pie di Grotta, like another Emperor
Carlo III., on the first day of his entry into Naples. Carriages dash
by me full of red jackets, or of men and women brandishing swords
and pikes, whilst the rain is pouring down in torrents, and the thunder
is pealing, as if it were a salute of heaven for the liberator of the
Two Sicilies. The weather prevented any grand display, though the
disposition was not wanting on the part of the people, as the flags
which hung down lank from the windows abundantly showed. The
weather brightened up toward the evening, and the town was more
brilliantly illuminated than last night. There can be no mistake
about the matter, the enthusiasm is very great. People are beside
themselves, and scenes are witnessed which, perhaps, have never
been witnessed in any other country under the sun. Two lines of
carriages go up and down the Toledo filled with persons decorated
with tri-colored ribbons and scarfs, and carrying the flag of Piedmont,
or rather of Italy. There are people of every class: there are
priests and monks, as gaily decorated as any, and some are armed;
there are women in the Garibaldian dress, and many carry daggers
<a id='Page_379'></a>or pikes; there are red jackets of Garibaldi and red jackets of England;
there are people from the provinces, who have scarcely dared
to speak or breathe for twelve long years, who are now frantic with
joy. What wonder if they have lost their senses?</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"But many adjourn to San Carlo,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> for Garibaldi is to be there,
and, indeed, one of our autumnal hurricanes of rain is coming down.
I was there when he arrived, and we knew of his approach from the
shouts of the populace outside. Every one is standing and craning
over his seat to catch a view of the great man, and at last he enters
the stage box, while many of his followers take possession of the
neighboring boxes, and a storm of applause greets him, and calls him
to the front. There are few spectacles so brilliant as San Carlo when
lighted up in gala fashion; and this evening particularly, with the
banners waving from the boxes, and from above the stage, it showed
better than I have ever before seen it; but altogether the demonstration
was a failure. The theatre was not two-thirds full, and when
those two magnificent pieces of music were performed, the 'Hymn
of Garibaldi' and 'The Chorus of the Lombardi,' not a voice joined
in. I wanted, together with my friends, to raise a chorus on our own
account, for it was irritating enough to witness a number of people
sitting and fanning themselves, as though they came to be amused,
instead of pouring out their very souls in honor of the great man
who had liberated them. I shall not say anything more of San Carlo.
On my road home, a poor fellow was found not far from my door
with a dagger in his body. I regret to say that several, if not many,
cases of assassination have occurred during the last three days.
Political fanatics have stopped every one, and threatened them with
the knife if they were not prompt in crying out 'Viva Garibaldi;'
and private vengeance has demanded its victims too, perhaps. But, take
it altogether, the people have not been sanguinary, and, considering
the immense provocation which they have received, order
has been wonderfully preserved, and little blood shed."</span></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. This theatre is one of the most splendid in Europe, and has five
galleries, all entirely covered with gilding.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi, from the first, gratified the Neapolitans, by
appointing natives to office. All public officers were, for the
moment, retained in their old stations. The holding of
several offices by one and the same person was forbidden,
and pluralists were to select, within five days, which office
they would retain.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_380'></a>All military men willing to serve were ordered to present
themselves at the nearest station, give in their adhesion to
the actual government, and take their certificate of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those officers who presented themselves with their troops
were retained in their positions in full activity; those who
presented themselves alone were placed in the second class,
to be employed when the army is reformed; those who did
not send in their adhesion in ten days were excluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The "Official Journal" of Naples of Sept. 9th, published
a series of decrees, of which the following are the most important:
All the acts of public authority and of administration
are to be issued in the name of His Majesty Victor
Emanuel, King of Italy, and all the seals of state, of public
administration, and of the public offices, are to bear the
arms of the Royal House of Savoy, with the legend, "Victor
Emanuel, King of Italy." The public debt of the Neapolitan
state was recognized; the public banks were to
continue their payments, as also the Discount Bank, according
to existing laws and regulations. Passports for the
United Italian States were abolished; those for foreign
states and Italian states not united were to be signed by
the Director of Police. The following address to the army
was published:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"If you do not disdain Garibaldi for your companion in arms, he
only desires to fight by your side the enemies of the country.
Truce, then, to discord—the chronic misfortune of our land. Italy,
trampling on the fragments of her chains, points to the north—the
path of honor, toward the last lurking-place of tyrants. I promise
you nothing more than to make you fight.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>"<span class='sc'>Naples</span>, <i>Sept. 10</i>."</p>

<p class='c007'>A series of dispatches was published from Nola, Benevento,
Aquila, and a host of other places, expressive of the
public joy at the arrival of the Dictator in the capital. In
Arriano and Avellino there had been a reactionary movement
<a id='Page_381'></a>among the liberals. Some disturbances also took place
in Canosa, and in the island of Ischia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Naples, the castles had all capitulated, and were in
the hands of the National Guard. The population gradually
settled down into its usual sober state, which had
recently been disturbed by the madness of exultation, and
before that by apprehension.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naples continued tranquil on the 11th of July, to the surprise
of everybody; and the means by which the public
peace was preserved at that time and afterward, may well
be a subject of curious inquiry. The public anticipations of
mobs, violence, robbery and bloodshed were as much and as
agreeably disappointed, as when the "<i>levée en masse</i>" in Turkey
was disbanded after the Russian war, and the soldiers
went home joyfully and peaceably. The truth is, that men
who desire power, wealth, and undeserved honors, have too
long accused their less ambitious or vicious fellow-beings of
needing their government. Naples with her 70,000 lazzaroni,
who are destitute even of shelter at night, remained quiet
during and subsequently to one of the most peaceful revolutions
on record.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following accounts were reported on the 11th of
September:</p>

<p class='c007'>The tranquillity of the town had not been disturbed, and
the same enthusiasm still prevailed. The Elmo and the other
forts have surrendered. The English admiral paid a visit to
Garibaldi, who afterward went on board the Hannibal, the
English ambassador being present. On that occasion the
Sardinian fleet fired a salute of seventeen guns in honor of
the dictator. The Sardinian troops disembarked by order
of the Dictator. It was said that the king, in leaving Naples,
ordered the bombardment of the town and the burning of
the royal castle, and that the original of the order has been
found. The king had formed a new royalist ministry, the
members of which are Caselli, Canofini, Girolamo, and Ulloa.
The Austrian, Russian, Prussian, and Spanish ministers, and
<a id='Page_382'></a>Papal nuncio, had followed the king to Gaeta. The whole
army of Garibaldi was to arrive at Naples in four days, and,
with the revolutionary bands, the total force was 20,000 or
30,000 men. The revolution was everywhere triumphant.
The Bixio and Medici brigades had just arrived in port.
The entrance of Garibaldi into Naples was celebrated at
Milan in the most enthusiastic manner. The whole city was
illuminated and decorated with flags. The very name of the
dictator inspired electric enthusiasm. A number of illuminated
drums, fixed on long poles, were carried through the
streets. The drums bore significant inscriptions, as follow:
"To Rome!" "To Venice!" "Rome, the capital!" Most
cities of Italy celebrated the annexation of Naples.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Neapolitan navy, which had deserted, all together, to
Garibaldi, he delivered to the Sardinian admiral. The Neapolitan
navy is of very respectable size, taking a place in
respect to materiel at least above the second rank in Europe.
It does not fall much below that of the United States.
The whole number of vessels amounts to ninety, carrying 786
guns, with a complement of upward of 7,000 sailors and officers
of all sorts. Of the vessels, 27 are propelled by steam.
Of these, one is of large size, carrying 60 guns; 11 are
frigates, armed with 10 guns each; 8 corvettes, with 8 guns
each, besides seven smaller vessels, each with four guns. Of
the sixty or more sailing vessels, the largest is armed with
80 guns. There are five frigates, carrying an aggregate of
252 guns, or about 50 each. Among the rest are bomb
and mortar boats in considerable number, and others armed
with Paixhan guns. These latter have been found useful by
the king, when he has felt inclined to indulge his propensity
of knocking down the palaces and cities of his disobedient
subjects.</p>
<h3 class='c032'>GARIBALDI'S PROCLAMATION TO THE CITIZENS OF NAPLES.</h3>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"To the beloved population of Naples, offspring of the people!
It is with true respect and love that I present myself to this noble and
<a id='Page_383'></a>imposing centre of the Italian population, which many centuries of
despotism have not been able to humiliate or to induce to bow their
knees at the sight of tyranny.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The first necessity of Italy was harmony, in order to unite the
great Italian family; to-day Providence has created harmony through
the sublime unanimity of all our provinces for the reconstitution of
the nation, and for unity, the same Providence has given to our
country Victor Emanuel, whom we from this moment may call the
true father of our Italian land.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Victor Emanuel, the model of all sovereigns, will impress upon
his descendants the duty that they owe to the prosperity of a people
which has elected him for their chief with enthusiastic devotion.
The Italian priests, who are conscious of their true mission, have, as
a guaranty of the respect with which they will be treated, the ardor,
the patriotism, and the truly Christian conduct of their numerous
fellow ecclesiastics, who, from the highly to be praised monks of
Lagracia to the noble-hearted priests of the Neapolitan continent,
one and all, in the sight and at the head of our soldiers, defied the
gravest dangers of battle. I repeat it, concord is the first want of
Italy, so we will welcome as brothers those who once disagreed with
us, but now sincerely wish to bring their stone to raise up the monument
of our country. Finally, respecting other people's houses: we
are resolved to be masters in our own house, whether the powerful
of the earth like it or not.</span></p>
<div class='c011'>"<span class='sc'>Giuseppe Garibaldi.</span>"</div>

<p class='c007'>The following were some of the occurrences in Naples
immediately after the entrance of Garibaldi.</p>

<p class='c007'>The four battalions of chasseurs whom the king had left
behind in his flight, quartered here and there about the town,
disbanded. Many of the soldiers went home; those who
wished to remain at Naples, secure from harm, did obeisance
to the new powers, by wearing a small badge with the Savoy
cross on their breasts. The fortress of St. Elmo followed the
example of the fleet. It fired a thundering salvo in honor
of Garibaldi, hoisted the Sardinian colors, and admitted the
national guards within its walls. The other forts were garrisoned
by this same burgher militia. Naples, in short, was
now wholly in the hands of the patriots, and Garibaldi had
already pushed forward one or two brigades, which gained
<a id='Page_384'></a>possession of the royal palace of Caserta. The king had shut
the gates of Capua. There and at Gaeta he was to abide
till his enemies should come on. Meanwhile Garibaldi,
master of the seas, sent his steamers to Paola, to Sapri, to
all the small ports near which his overtasked legions lingered
behind. Every morning were shouts of a joyous landing and
a triumphant march of those several brigades. The whole
force was soon brought together, and the respite allowed to
the king at Gaeta was of no long duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The joy of the good Neapolitans at their cheaply-gotten
emancipation, became daily more noisy and frantic. Every
evening the Toledo was all alive with banners and torches,
with thronged masses of possessed people, all shouting out
with all the might of their southern throats, that favorite
cry, "<i>Una! Una! Una!</i>" —conveying their desire that all
Italy should be made <i>one</i> country. There was a grand gala
night at San Carlo, when the proscenium, the pit, and the
boxes became one vast stage. The whole performance consisted
of <i>Io Pæans</i> to Garibaldi, who, calm and serene in his
homely garb, had a pleasant word for all the friends who
surrounded him in his box, and was, in fact, less insensible
to that popular demonstration than he might have wished to
avow.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the greatest objects of interest was the easily-won
castle St. Elmo. The whole population of Naples, male and
female, seemed bent on performing a pilgrimage to that shrine
of their patriot martyrs.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of Garibaldi's soldiers thus described it:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Yesterday I went up myself with a party of friends. We first
walked through St. Martin's marble church and monastery, where our
Garibaldian red shirts, I dare say, boded little good to the
white-cowled monks, who gazed at us as we passed, tall, stately, and
motionless, so that we at first mistook them for statues;—good
Carthusian monks, doing penance in a marble paradise, bound by vow to
perpetual silence, and affecting an easy, unconcerned air, though in
their heart of hearts, probably, trembling not a little for the visible
<a id='Page_385'></a>and invisible treasures of which their sanctuary has been, time out of
mind, the repository.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"From the marble cells of the monks to the iron dungeons of the
victims of Castle St. Elmo the transition is but short, but the contrast
is appalling. The stone steps wind down six floors, and at every floor
room was made for about half a score of victims. Some of the miserable
cells had windows; but, as the view from the hill over the loveliest
panorama of land and sea would have been too great a solace to
the lonely captive, the window was latticed over by thick wooden
bars, not intended to prevent escape—for from that height only a
bird could attempt it—but simply to rob the poor recluse of the distant
view of his familiar scenes. In the lowest floor there is no window
to the dungeons—only a little wicket in the door, opening outwardly,
for the gaoler to communicate with the prisoner if he has a
mind. That wicket would be opened one moment in the morning to
let in a little bread and water; then the wicket would fall to, and for
twenty-four hours all would be darkness inside.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"I do not like to witness horrors, much less to dwell upon them,
else I could tell you of the loopholes we were shown, through which
the sentries could shoot the prisoners in their cells and their beds. I
could repeat the instances of wholesale executions of Swiss and Sicilian
mutineers of which St. Elmo has been the theatre, and of which
the world never knew anything. The caitiffs who were but yesterday
in the king's pay are eager to promulgate abroad the infamy of his
doings, and I have no doubt St. Elmo will soon become the subject
of books or pamphlets, yielding but little in interest to the stories of
La Bastille, of which it will soon share the fate.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The good people of Naples are bent upon demolishing St. Elmo,
and are only awaiting the dictator's bidding to lay hand to the work.
A tough job they will find it, I am sure. As I was walking yesterday
along the upper battlements the impatient citizens were already busy
pulling back the huge brass guns, each of which was most offensively
pointed at some of the most densely crowded quarters of the town,
and turning their muzzles inward. What a fortress that was, and what
a protection to the city! It was no bad emblem of the whole sea and
land might of the Bourbon—worse than useless against foreign aggression,
wholly and exclusively directed to crush internal commotion."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The condition of Naples on the 12th of September was
thus described in a private letter of that date:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"There is much to be done here, and Garibaldi is doing it well.
It is impossible to take up a journal, or move about in the midst of
<a id='Page_386'></a>the vast crowds which throng the capital, without feeling that a
master-spirit is here. Long before the city has shaken off its slumber,
the dictator is up and driving about. Yesterday he went to visit
Nisida, and surprised the British library, on his return, with a visit
at half-past six o'clock <span class='fss'>A.M</span>, wishing to purchase some books. During
the day he was hard at work receiving visitors and legislating, and
the following are some of the fruits of his labors:</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"All political prisoners are to be liberated immediately. All
custom-house barriers between Sicily and the Neapolitan continent are
abolished. Twelve infant asylums, one for each quarter, are to be
established in the capital at the public expense, and are to be
municipal institutions. Secret ministerial funds are abolished. The
trial by jury in criminal cases is to be established. The order of
Jesuits, with all their dependencies, is abolished in the territory. Two
Sicilies, and their property declared national. All contracts on
property for the benefit of the order are annulled. Considering that
religious fanaticism and aristocratic pride induced the late government
to make distinctions even between the dead, the burial of the dead is
henceforward absolutely forbidden within the walls of a city. The
traffic in grain and flour with Ancona is prohibited.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"All these decrees have a history attached to them, which, if narrated,
would tell of sufferings and persecutions almost incredible.
They are admirable, and in themselves amount to a beneficial revolution;
but the better and the more sweeping the changes that are introduced,
the greater the necessity for some established government.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"His majesty, Francis II. has already formed his ministry, and
placed at the head of it Gen. Cotruffiano; and among his colleagues
are Caselli, Ulloa—not the general—and Canofari, all of the legal
profession.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"MM. Maniscalchi, father and son, notorious for having been the
most active agents of the late king's tyranny at Palermo, were arrested
on the 7th, at Caserta, and taken under escort to Naples."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Another letter, written on the same day, gave the following
additional particulars:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Troops are continually coming in and marching to the frontier. The
Piedmontese admiral, with another steam frigate and the ex-Neapolitan
ships, is in the harbor.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"I hear the sound of cracked trumpets, and, looking out, see the
first ranks of a Garibaldi division coming down the Santa Lucia. I
am struck by the youthful appearance of some, certainly not more
<a id='Page_387'></a>than twelve, or at the furthest fourteen years old—fair, pretty-looking
boys, who might have had a satchel instead of a knapsack on their backs.
There were, however, some glorious-looking fellows, and all, whether
men or boys, seemed to be animated by a spirit little known to the
Neapolitan troops. The latter were a sect to defend a vile political
creed, and inflict chastisement on those who opposed it; but the former
are banded together to assert the sacred rights of liberty. I saw
it in their march; there was an elasticity about it which denoted what
was passing within. I cannot say much for their uniforms; they were
very dirty, out of order, and irregular, and I have no doubt but that
so eminent a general officer as Ferdinand II. would have been much
scandalized; but they were evidently working men, had an object in
view, and were not going to fight for money. I have seen hundreds
of them about the town to-day; they are billeted about in the hotels
and lodging-houses, while the Piedmontese troops are in Castel-Ovo.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The city is in immense confusion—crowded, picturesque, almost
mad. Foreigners seem to outnumber the Neapolitans, and the red
jacket every other colored cloth. Such a Babel is every public place
that I imagine myself to be living some thousand years back—Englishmen
just arrived, hob-nobbing with Italians, whose only common
lingo is that of the fingers. Many of our countrymen came on Tuesday,
and I watched some of them carrying on a most animated,
though purely gesticulatory, conversation with Frenchmen yesterday
morning."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>After the peaceful and triumphal entry of Garibaldi into
Naples, new rumors were put into circulation of a pretended
disagreement between him and the King of Sardinia. These
were most satisfactorily refuted by the measures which the
victorious general adopted immediately afterward. On the
14th of July, he proclaimed the government of Victor
Emanuel, placed all the ships of war and commerce, the
arsenals and materials of marine, by decree, at the disposal of
Sardinia, and put them into the hands of Admiral Persaro;
the portfolio of the interior was confirmed to Liborio Romano,
the only member of the late ministry who enjoyed the confidence
of the people. The choice of Scialoia, who had
already left Genoa to assume the ministry of finance, was very
generally applauded. Two battalions of genuine Piedmontese
Bersaglieri were landed from the Sardinian men-of-war,
<a id='Page_388'></a>and took possession of the Darsena. Telegraphic orders were
sent for two more Piedmontese regiments to garrison the
Neapolitan forts. By taking the Neapolitan marine under
its command, and occupying the strongholds, dockyards and
arsenals about this place, the Sardinian government committed
itself more openly to the annexation of these kingdoms
than it ever dared to do in the case of Tuscany or
Romagna last year. And all these measures were taken
not only with the consent but by the express desire of Garibaldi,
who certainly exhibited no apprehension that the
king's government would interfere with his vast undertakings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The extreme joy with which the news of Garibaldi's
entrance into Naples was received by all classes and parties,
from Messina to the Alps, can be best understood by those
who know the detestation with which the oppression and
vindictive cruelty of the late government were universally
regarded. This feeling was greatly increased by the disappointment
of the nation in all those hopes to which the
death of Ferdinand had given birth, and the conviction that
his successor was determined to tread in his father's steps
rather than enter sincerely on any new course. When
Francis II. ascended the throne, it was felt that a young
monarch, above all, one educated as he had been, had every
claim to public consideration, and very sincere hopes were
for the time entertained, that he would cease to follow the
beaten track of Bourbon perjury and despotism, and frankly
identify himself with the wants and aspirations of his country.
Possessing, through his mother, a considerable hold
on the affections of his subjects, and succeeding a sovereign
who was detested by his people, he had an excellent position,
and by a judicious system of even moderate reforms, might
have conciliated all parties and opposed a successful barrier
to the tide of revolution that was soon to sweep over the
landmarks of Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The amnesty was followed by a "circular" which struck
at its very root and replaced thousands under the surveillance
<a id='Page_389'></a>of the police. Then came the infamous and illegal
deportation to Capri of men who had never been put upon
their trial, and upon whose liberation England had insisted,
through her minister, in the strongest terms. A system was
pursued that has been characterized as a perpetual violation
of all law, and a practical denial of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general satisfaction felt by the people of Naples after
Garibaldi's arrival amounted to enthusiasm. An Englishman,
writing from that city on the 14th of July, thus described
the aspect of the people:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"I do not know Naples now, so changed is its aspect. Faces that
I have not seen for twelve years appear in every street and square.
They have come from foreign exile; from confinement in some frontier
town or village; from some voluntary lurking place, the retirement
to which was their only security from persecution; from the
prison and the bagnio; all have met together again, by hundreds
and thousands, in the capital of what was once the two Sicilies.
Revolution is said to turn the dregs uppermost; yet the appearance
and manner of those who now appear on the scene contradict the
common proverb. In their very attitude, there is an air of self-respect
and independence to which I have long been a stranger.
I do not see the assumption or the swagger of the overbearing, or the
timidity of the man who leaves his friend, and walks on before,
because a spy is coming, or whispers and looks over his shoulder for
fear that such a person is listening. No; all this has passed away,
and I meet erect, independent men. My life here has brought me,
too, into frequent intercourse with them; and, accustomed as I have
been to the trivialities and the nullities rendered at first necessary,
and afterward habitual, by despotism, I have been astonished at the
new tone of thought and conversation. The Neapolitans now reason
and talk like men, and there is a degree of self-restraint about them
which is in the highest degree creditable after the sufferings to which
they have been so long exposed. It is clear that the intellect of the
country has for years been out of it, or in seclusion, or in
imprisonment. Nor is this to be wondered at, when ignorance was rewarded
and learning discouraged by those twins of darkness, the sovereign
and the clergy, and the only hopes of the Bourbons and the Vatican
depend upon brutalizing the national mind. Ferdinand II. it was
who interrupted a father describing the acquirements of his son by
<a id='Page_390'></a>saying, 'Better he had a stone round his neck, and be thrown into
the sea;' and it was a priest who held a high public office, who
checked a person indulging in a similar style of speaking by saying
that it would be well for the rising generation to be 'little asses and
little saints.' These times are, however, passing away; heaven grant
that the light of freedom and intelligence may not dazzle the as yet
unaccustomed vision of the natives.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"We have likenesses of Victor Emanuel and of Garibaldi in every
shop window, and multitudes crowd around them to admire; in
short, there is at present a <i>furia</i> for the <i>Re Galantuomo</i> and the
Hero of Sicily."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>The prisons of the police were thus described by the same
writer:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"I yesterday saw some of them. Several members of the commission
appointed to close them—themselves once prisoners here—accompanied
me. A grated door led down to an ante-chamber, which was lighted
only through these bars. Stone walls, stone floor—stone
everywhere, except the ground, which was covered over with
burnt fragments of books, that had been taken in domiciliary visits
and destroyed here. 'Here one breathes,' said a pardoned prisoner;
'but bring a light,' he said to a jailer, and we descended from this
twilight room into another which received the reflection of the twilight
through a hole in the door. It was small and of stone—nothing
but stone—and on the right I observed a stone bed three feet high
from the ground, with an elevation of stone called a pillow. A door is
opened and leads into another room, where no twilight, no reflected
twilight, nor a ray of light nor a breath of air can penetrate. 'I
was imprisoned here,' said one of my conductors. I looked at him
as if expecting to find that he was turned into a brute beast, for it
was a den for a wild animal, not a chamber for a Christian man, in a
country teeming with Christ's ministers, and where the holy Apostolic
Catholic religion is the only one permitted to be professed. In some
parts a man could not stand upright, so that there he lay in Stygian
darkness, without any change of air, 'and on bare ground,' said my
friend, 'unless he could afford to pay an extortionate price for a
mattress, to a licensed spy and denouncer, who drove a good trade in
human misery.' 'Let us leave this den,' I said, and so we groped
back into the chamber where the reflection of twilight penetrated.
'Take care,' cried the jailer, as I stumbled over a mountain of old
books and papers. On the opposite side was another <i>criminale</i>
<a id='Page_391'></a>about eleven by five palms, where five or six persons were at times
confined. The smell of the prison was insufferable. Now mark,
who were the men confined in these places not fit for beasts? Not
condemned criminals; no! but men arrested on suspicion and waiting
for an order for their committal—men of rank and education
accustomed to the comforts of a home."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The following passages from a letter written at Florence,
are very appropriate in this place:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The ministry appointed by the Dictator is a liberal but moderate
one. Garibaldi is in earnest in his devotion to the King of Sardinia,
and in his determination to unite Italy under his rule. It is to be
hoped that he will, as soon as may be, commence the work of raising
the Neapolitan people out of some of the absurd superstitions which
have always kept them in ignorance, and made them the serfs of
juggling priests. He has not yet countenanced, by his presence at the
operation, the ridiculous juggle of the liquefaction of the blood of
Saint Januarius, which is held in such high esteem by the Neapolitans,
that all the conquerors of the city have heretofore been obliged
to respect it. Saint Januarius, according to tradition, was exposed to
be devoured by lions in the amphitheatre of Pozzuoli, when the animals,
instead of devouring him, prostrated themselves before him,
and immediately became tame. So many persons were converted to
Christianity by this miracle, that the saint was ordered to be
decapitated, which was done at Solfatara, in the year 305, and the body
was buried at Pozzuoli, until the time of Constantine, when it was
removed by St. Severus, the Bishop of Naples, and deposited in the
church of St. Gennaro. When this removal was made, the woman
who is said to have collected the blood at the time of the execution,
took it in two small bottles to St. Severus, in whose hands it is said
to have immediately melted. After undergoing several removals,
the body of the saint was brought back to Naples in 1497, and deposited
with great pomp in the cathedral, and the phials containing the blood
secured in a tabernacle kept securely locked with two keys, one of which
is kept by the archbishop and the other by the municipal authorities.
Twice a year, and at other times, on extraordinary occasions, the
phials are brought out, and the clots of dried blood, by some chemical
process which has been secretly preserved among the priesthood and
handed down for four centuries, made to liquefy and run in the phials.
<a id='Page_392'></a>Can a people appreciate and derive much benefit from free institutions
so long as they permit their senses to be cheated by such a palpable
swindle as this?</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"But if detestation for young Bomba and his government have been
heightened by his flight, how much more grandly than ever Garibaldi
looms up in the light of a brave, noble, disinterested, patriotic man.
Three months from the day when he left Genoa with a handful of
adventurers, denounced as a filibuster and a pirate by the lovers of
legitimacy and tyranny, he enters Naples with but five of his staff,
knowing that his deeds had made him a home in the hearts of the
people there, who welcome him as their angel of deliverance.
Naples lights up with joy—the free flag of Italy waves from her windows,
her long oppressed citizens shout exultingly, and crown the
hero with wreaths of laurel, and fill his ears with glad cries of 'Long
live Garibaldi.' Well does he deserve them. Five marvellous stages
mark the progress of the hero, Marsala, Palermo, Malazzo, Reggio,
and Naples, all passed over in the short space of three months—and
this has been all the time which Garibaldi required, supported as he
was by the national sentiment, to overthrow a monarchy deemed
immovable, which, not four years since, defied France and England,
and which in the face of the naval preparations of the two greatest
powers of the world, had determined to persevere in its resistance.
Such triumphs, such ovations, would have turned the brain of a
weaker or more ambitious man, and Garibaldi has given the lie to
those adherents of tyranny who have charged him with personal
ambition, by immediately, upon taking possession of the capital of
the Two Sicilies, proclaiming the territory and himself under the
reign and rule of Victor Emanuel. In future ages, when the deeds
of the Cæsars and the Alexanders and the Napoleons shall be appreciated
as they deserve, according to their merits, how high above
them all will rise the memory of the two greatest of the world's
heroes, of the two men whose personal ambition was merged and
forgotten in the welfare of their country, of two men worthy to
stand ever side by side and hand in hand—Washington and Garibaldi."</span></p>

PALERMO—RETURNS—THE KING AND HIS ARMY AT GAETA AND
CAPUA—DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY OF GAETA AND CAPUA—PRESENT
CONDITION OF GAETA.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>In what a peculiar, unexpected, and unaccountable condition
must the minds of the citizens of Naples have been
before and after the arrival of Garibaldi! Whoever has
visited that city, as thousands of our countrymen have done,
and, while admiring the celebrated climate and scenery,
observed the poverty, ignorance, superstition, and idleness
of the mass of the people, especially the Lazzaroni—seventy
thousand of whom, it has often been asserted, have no home
or shelter, or certain means of subsistence—must have been
ready to believe that scenes of lawless violence might be excited
there with great facility, and that riots might occur if
the government were weakened even for a moment. How
strong and general, then, must have been the salutary influences
at work to preserve peace and order in that population
of nearly a million, under the circumstances which have been
reviewed! What could possibly have secured such results
but the faithful care of wise and good men? The patriotic
committee must have been successful in their efforts to enlighten
people of all classes, and to instill patriotic sentiments
into the hearts even of the Lazzaroni themselves; and
they and the rulers must have been well acquainted with the
effects which had thus been produced, or they would never
<a id='Page_394'></a>have suffered, much less invited, Garibaldi to enter Naples
as he did, with only a few unarmed friends, and meet with so
peaceful and kind a reception.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 17th of September, Garibaldi made a flying visit
to Palermo, in the Neapolitan steamer Electrica. His
arrival was entirely unexpected; but, on his way from the
landing to the palace, he was recognized by the crowd, who
followed and assembled beneath the palace windows. He
made his appearance on the balcony, and addressed them in
these words:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"People of Palermo, with whom I have shared fatigues, perils
and glory, I am once more among you. Your memory is dear to me,
and whatever part of the world I may be in, I will always think
of you.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Those who wished to urge you to a speedy annexation, were
putting you in the wrong path. If I had followed their advice, I
should not have crossed the Straits and restored seven millions of men
to Italy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"They would have prostrated us at the feet of diplomacy, which
would have bound us hand and foot. There would have been brothers
beyond the Vulturnus, with chains on their ankles. People of
Palermo, I thank you in the name of Italy for your resistance. I
love Italy and Victor Emanuel; no one is a greater friend than
myself of Victor Emanuel, the representative of Italy. You despised
their counsels, and I thank you for it, you invincible people of
the barricades."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The following proclamation was issued by Garibaldi to the
inhabitants of Palermo:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"The people of Palermo, who showed no fear in face of those
who bombarded their city, have shown themselves recently equally
regardless of fear in face of corrupt men, who want to lead them
astray.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"They have spoken to you of annexation, as if any one was more
fervent than myself for the regeneration of Italy; but their object
was to serve personal interests, and you replied like a people who
felt its own dignity, and placed confidence in the sacred and
unviolated programme which I proclaimed—'Italy and Victor
Emanuel.'</span></p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_395'></a><span class='small'>"At Rome, people of Palermo, we will proclaim the kingdom of
Italy, and there only will be sanctified the great family-bond between
free men and those who are still slaves of the same country.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"At Palermo annexation was demanded, that I might not pass the
Straits; at Naples it is demanded that I may not cross the Volturno.
But as long as there are chains to be broken in Italy, I will follow my
course or bury my bones there.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"I leave you Mordini, as pro-Dictator, and certainly he will show
himself worthy of you and of Italy. I have yet to thank you, as well
as the brave national militia, for the faith you have placed in me and
in the destinies of our country.</span></p>
<div class='c011'>"<span class='sc'>Garibaldi.</span></div>
<p class='c007'>"<span class='sc'>Palermo</span>, <i>Sept. 17, 1860</i>."</p>

<p class='c007'>The following proclamation was addressed to the Palermitans
a few days before:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Near to you, or far from you, brave people of Palermo, I am with
you, and with you for all my life!</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Bonds of affection, community of fatigue, of danger, of glory, bind
me to you with indissoluble ties; moved from the very depths of my
soul, with my conscience as Italian, I know that you will not doubt
my words. I separated myself from you for the common cause, and
I left you another self—Depretis! Depretis is confided by me to the
good people of the capital of Sicily; and, more than my representative,
he is the representative of the holy national idea, 'Italy and
Victor Emanuel.' Depretis will announce to the dear people of Sicily
the day of the annexation of the island to the rest of free Italy.
But it is Depretis who must determine—faithful to my mission and to
the interest of Italy—the fortunate epoch. The miserable beings who
talk to you of annexation to-day, people of Sicily, are the same who a
month ago spoke to you and stirred you up; I ask them, people, if I had
condescended to their individual littlenesses, could I have continued
to fight for Italy—could I have sent you this day my salutation
of love from the beautiful capital of the Southern Italian continent?
Well, then, noble people, to the cowards who hid themselves
when you fought in the barricades of Palermo for the liberties of
Italy, you will say, from your Garibaldi, that the annexation and
the kingdom of King Victor Emanuel we will proclaim quickly;
but there, on the heights of the Quirinal, when Italy shall count her
sons in one family, and receive all as free men in her illustrious
bosom, and bless them.</span></p>
<div class='c011'>"<span class='sc'>G. Garibaldi.</span>"</div>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_396'></a>Garibaldi has always been humane and sympathizing, and
especially with his own suffering soldiers. Of this there are
proofs in the preceding pages. Few men ever knew as well
as he how to make the unfortunate feel that they were compassionated.
The following is an account of one of his visits
to the hospitals of Palermo, from the letter of one of our own
countrymen, who had offered his services as a surgeon early
in the Sicilian war:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"One of the most moving sights it has been my lot to witness, was
Garibaldi's visit here the other morning. As he entered the different
wards, it seemed as though an electric shock had been communicated
to all the inmates; after the first joyful cry: '<i>E lui! E Garibaldi!
E il Generale!</i>" a dead silence prevailed; all eyes were fixed upon
him as he passed from bed to bed, taking the thin, wasted hands in
his, or pressing his own upon many a feverish brow, making each
patient feel that he was his general's favorite son, and that from him
he might expect all that a father's tenderness could give. All his own
men were known to him; he called them by their names, remembered
where and how they were wounded, promoted this one, promised
honorable employment to others disabled for military service, granting
permission to others to go home, and providing them with ample
means. When he came to the Sicilians, he inquired kindly into their
wants and condition; ordered that the pay of one should be doubled,
that another should be pensioned, and so on. But perhaps the most
interesting scene of all was his visit to the Neapolitan ward, where
we have eleven wounded prisoners, who have petitioned to enter our
ranks. After being told that they were wounded at Calata Fimi, he
said, 'Then you are brave men, truly! You have been misled;
taught to look on us as enemies. I am fortunate to have you for my
soldiers and for brothers.' Those men, strong and stalwart as they
were, wept like little children, and in Garibaldi's eyes were tears;
none could help weeping, and one felt why it is that he is so loved, so
idolized by all. When the emotion had a little passed, they tried to
kiss his hands; he snatched them away. 'No, no!' he said, 'no
more <i>Eccellenza</i>; no more kissing of hands; that is servile. We
are Italians—brothers—we are equals!'"</span></p>

<p class='c007'>On Garibaldi's return to Naples, he had soon to turn his
attention from the city toward the strongholds to which the
<a id='Page_397'></a>poor king had retired, in the northwestern extremity of his
late kingdom. The only territory now remaining to him of
"the Two Sicilies," was the remarkable promontory of
Gaeta and the adjacent range of mountainous and hilly
country, extending southwesterly a few miles, near the
frontier of the Pope's dominions, and along the courses of the
rivers Volturno and Garigliano, to the heights of Capua.
Gaeta and Capua have long been strong fortresses, and have
known, at different periods, the hard fate of war. In Gaeta
the present pope found a refuge, when he fled from Rome in
1848; thence were sent the calls to his spiritual subjects in
all countries, to make contributions of "Peter's pence," and
the demands on "Catholic powers," to reinstate the "Gentle
Shepherd" in his sheepfold—by force of arms. That call
was answered by four monarchs; one of whom, the savage
father of the now fugitive King of Naples, had his armies,
too, routed by the now victorious Garibaldi; and another,
Louis Napoleon, after having his advance of 8,000 men
driven back by the same hero, at the point of the bayonet,
afterward, by false faith and overwhelming numbers, took
the city by fraud and bombshells, and, on one pretext and
another, has held it to the present time. He, however, has
recently done so much for Italy, and seems resolved to do
so much more, that her friends gladly indulge the hope, that
he will continue a course quite the opposite of that which
history was compelled to record nearly twelve years ago, and
which posterity will ever be compelled emphatically to condemn.</p>

<p class='c007'>A description of Gaeta, Capua, and Caserta will be necessary
to many readers, before a connected account is given of
the important military events which took place in that
remarkable vicinity in October and November, 1860.</p>

<p class='c007'>The traveller who leaves Naples for Rome, soon joins the
route taken by the Apostle Paul from Puteoli. He first
crosses the Campagna di Lavoro (country of labor), formerly
called by the Romans, the Campania Felix (happy country),
and now covered with countless fields, pastures, gardens and
<a id='Page_398'></a>forests of vineyards. At the distance of about twenty miles,
he reaches the foot of the bare mountain range above
mentioned, where are seen the ruins of ancient Capua;
and after winding among eminences—among scenes desolate
compared with those he has seen—and crossing the Volturno
and the Garigliano, he stops at Castello or Mola di Gaeta.
From the windows or terrace of the post-house he looks out
through a garden of flowers and orange-trees, upon a fine
bay, several miles across, the shores of which, low and curving
round on the right, extend to a high, round mountain
opposite, where a city is seen at its foot, and the zigzag
walls and batteries of a mighty fortress on its sides and
summit. That is Gaeta.</p>

<p class='c007'>When seen and sketched by the writer, not a ship or boat
lay on the noble bay, and there was scarcely a sign of life on
the land. Cicero's tomb (if tradition may be trusted) is
one of the large square masses of brick-work, overgrown
with ivy, which stand near the road beyond the hotel; for
on his way to Gaeta was the great Roman orator assassinated,
by command of the treacherous Octavius.</p>

<p class='c007'>An old Latin itinerary of Italy gives several pages to the
history and description of Gaeta, which was considered an
almost impregnable fortress two centuries ago, being a
peninsula connected with the mainland only by a fortified
bridge, and having many forts and batteries.</p>

<p class='c007'>We translate the following account of Gaeta with abridgments,
from a celebrated work, "The History of Naples
from 1734 to 1835," by General Pietro Colleta:</p>

<p class='c007'>The first walls of this city were raised by the Trojans,
according to ancient tradition; and Æneas named it after
his nurse, Caieta, who was buried there. It soon increased
and was extended. Alfonzo, of Aragon, erected a castle;
Charles V. inclosed the city with fortified walls, and succeeding
kings added new defensive works. In 1734, it was
besieged by the Spaniards, and was then almost as it is now.
It is situated on a promontory, at the end of a low isthmus
<a id='Page_399'></a>of the Tirrenian sea, the descent to which is very abrupt.
The isthmus extends, in a narrow plain, to the mountains of
Castellona and Itri.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the summit of Gaeta is the very ancient tower of
Orlando. The walls of the fortress follow the declivities of
the ground, and present bastions, curtains and angles defending
every point, modern science being brought into use, as far as
the nature of the ground would permit. On the land side
is a second inclosure within the first, with two fosses, two
covered ways, and several parade grounds. The citadel is
called the Castle of Alfonzo.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Duke of Liria besieged the place with 16,000 Spaniards,
well provided with ships of war, arms, machines and
supplies, when it was defended by 1,000 Germans and 500
Neapolitans of the battalion formed by the Duke of Montaleone.
Trenches were soon opened, and approaches made,
by covered ways, toward the wall, while several cannon and
mortar batteries were raised, to batter the citadel, and reply
to the guns of the fortress. The Duke of Montemar and
Charles V. joined the besiegers, pressed the siege, and, after
some delay, the place was surrendered, after small loss on
both sides. Only Capua then remained bearing the standard
of Cæsar; the Count de Traun commanding the Germans,
and Count Marsillac the Spaniards, who had been, as on
previous occasions, friends, enemies, and prisoners to one
another, often disappointed by ill-fortune, but always with
benevolent hearts. The preceding facts we have abridged
from the first volume of Colleta's history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the time of the surrender in 1734 and the treaty
of Aix la Chapelle, and during the fears of war in the reign
of Ferdinand, the old walls and bulwarks were restored, and
the place surrounded by two walls, and in front were formed
a fosse and two covered ways. The siege was commenced
in February, by about 14,000 men against 7,000, in the
form of a blockade, as the besiegers were destitute of heavy
artillery and besieging apparatus. By the end of May, cannon
<a id='Page_400'></a>being obtained, and batteries having been constructed
at Montesecco, the trench was opened, and branches extended
toward the two sides of the isthmus, and formed the
first parallel. But, the soil being bare and composed of hard
calcareous rock, earth was brought from a distance, and fascines
and gabions from the woods of Fondi, twelve miles
distant. Much wood, however, was obtained by destroying
the houses in the vicinity, which had been inhabited by nine
thousand sailors and other industrious people, who had fled
from the scene of war. Batteries were raised to fire upon
ships approaching, and Sicilian and English vessels were
several times driven off with loss. The fortress kept up firing
day and night, and 2,000 shots were made in twenty-four hours
without doing any injury or receiving any reply from the
besiegers. By the beginning of July, preparations were made
to open breaches in the citadel and the Bastion della Breccia;
and on the 7th, after the long silence on the part of
the besiegers, a tremendous fire was opened with eighty
heavy cannon and mortars, to which the besieged promptly
replied. After ten days of continued firing, the citadel was
breached, but the bastion held out until the 19th. On the
morning of the 20th, when the French had shown themselves
ready to assault, the garrison demanded terms and
surrendered. They took an oath not to fight France or her
confederates, and 3,400 were transported to Sicily, some
hundreds remained in the hospital, some escaped, and others
deserted to the conquerors. About 900 Bourbonists were
killed and wounded, and 1,100 Frenchmen. Among the
former was Prince Phillipstadt, and among the latter, General
Vallongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1798, Gaeta was surrendered to General Rey. While
the left wing of the French army was proceeding slowly
through the Abruzzi, the right wing reached the Garigliano,
and summoned the Swiss commander of Gaeta, Marshal
Tschiudi, to surrender. The latter being a Swiss mercenary,
who had risen to rank by marriage and promotion
<a id='Page_401'></a>without merit, urged by the bishop and intimidated by the
first missile thrown by the French, gave up the fortress
without conditions. Four thousand men, and a formidable
fortress well prepared for resistance, were thus given up,
with 60 brass cannon, 12 mortars, 20,000 arquebuses, a
year's provisions, machines, ships in the harbor, and innumerable
materials for defence. The soldiers were sent into
prison, but the commander secured himself and officers the
shameful distinction of liberty on parole.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Mack still held out in Capua, and Gen. Macdonald
hoped to find him also a coward or a traitor; but
his assault was resisted with vigor, after the outposts had
been driven in, and the attempt was fruitless. Capua was
given up to Gen. Championet by the treaty of Jan. 13, 1799.</p>

<p class='c007'>The present condition of Gaeta is thus described by recent
Turin papers:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Gaeta is a second Gibraltar. It is armed with seven hundred
pieces of artillery. All the sovereigns, from Charles V. downward,
have added to its defences. Ferdinand II. fortified its most vulnerable
points. Our army will find great difficulties in taking it; but
this siege will not hinder the political and military reorganization of
southern Italy, a task to which the government is devoting its utmost
efforts. Gaeta has provisions for six months, and during the siege,
the representatives of foreign powers will remain on board ships of
war belonging to their nations at anchor in the port.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The front of attack on the land side does not exceed 700 metres
in extent. It is defended by works cut in the rock, and armed with
three rows of faced batteries, one of which has rifled cannon. These
batteries together mount about 300 guns, and their line of fire
converges on the points from which the attack must necessarily be made.
The ditch at the foot of the escarpment is cut in the rock, and the
bottom of the escarpment itself is completely covered. The other
fortified points are protected by masses of rocks, which render them
unapproachable. The ground in front of the place of attack is so rocky
that any approaches must be most difficult, and occupy a considerable
time. Independently of those defences, Gaeta possesses a
certain number of works established on the heights, among which
may be mentioned the Castle, the Tower of St. Francis, and the
<a id='Page_402'></a>Monte Orlando, a strong fort, which commands both the land side
and the sea. As to the port, it is defended by considerable works,
which would cause great damage to vessels of war built of wood. In
the situation in which Gaeta now is, and with the sea side remaining
free in consequence of the non-recognition of the blockade by European
powers, it may, with a garrison of from 6,000 to 7,000 men, with
supplies of all kinds, defend itself for an almost indefinite period.
The struggle will be confined on both sides to a combat of artillery.
The besiegers may establish mortar batteries and bombard the place,
but that means will only occasion the destruction of the churches,
public buildings and private houses, but will not make the defenders
of it surrender, for the batteries and forts are all bomb-proof. The
king had put one wing of his palace into strong defence, and to it
retired with his family."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Francis II. had issued the following order of the day:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"<span class='sc'>Soldiers</span>: When, after two months of generous efforts, perfect
self-devotion, labor and fatigue, we thought we had completed the
work of crushing the revolutionary invasion of our country, there
arrived the regular army of a friendly sovereign, which, by threatening
our line of retreat, has obliged us to abandon our position.
Happen what may from these events, the whole of Europe, in estimating
and judging them, will not be able to do less than admit the valor
and fidelity of a handful of brave men, who, resisting the perfidious
seduction, as well as the strength of two armies, have not only
made resistance, but have once more rendered illustrious the history of
the Neapolitan army by the names of Santa Maria, Cajazzo, Trifisco,
Sant' Angelo, etc. These facts will remain indelibly graven on my
heart. To perpetuate the remembrance of them, a bronze medal
will be struck, bearing the legend, 'Campaign of September and
October, 1860,' and these words on the reverse, 'Santa Maria, Cajazzo,
Trifisco, Sant' Angelo,' etc. The medal will be suspended by a
blue and red ribbon. While ornamenting your noble breasts, it will
remind every one of your fidelity and your valor, which will always
be a claim to glory for those who shall bear your name.</span></p>

<p class='c012'><b><span class='small'>THE ROYAL PALACE AND GARDENS OF CASERTA—CHANGE
OF TIMES—THE RIVER VOLTURNO—POSITIONS OF THE KING'S
TROOPS AND GARIBALDI'S—THE BATTLE OF VOLTURNO.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>Before we return to scenes of battle, we must stop to survey
the splendid and luxurious retreat of the King of Naples,
where Garibaldi had now established his head-quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The palace and gardens of Caserta, as we saw them in
a time of peace, we may thus briefly describe: An avenue
opens before us a mile in length, at the end of which is seen
the palace, presenting a front of white marble, seven hundred
and forty-six feet in length, with a spacious square in
front. From the broad steps the visitor discovers that he
has unconsciously been rising some distance above the level of
the Bay of Naples, now far behind him. But his attention
is attracted within the splendid palace, where a noble portal
receives him, with a staircase on his right, made of the celebrated
variegated marbles of the kingdom, which has had
few if any equals.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would require chapters to describe the almost innumerable
apartments, ante-chambers, waiting halls, reception
<a id='Page_404'></a>halls, etc. Within its vast compass are two theatres, one of
which is said to be inferior only to San Carlo in the capital.
The front view of the edifice gives a very inadequate
impression of its real dimensions; as it covers an area
five hundred and sixty-four feet deep, with sides and a
back front in the same style, and two interior ranges crossing
at right angles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The glimpses we catch of the garden, through the spacious
halls, or from the upper windows, invite us to hasten through
the palace; and a charming view bursts upon us as we
reach the rear portal. A tract of land a mile in extent
gradually rises to the hills of Capua, covered with gardens
and groves, lawns and avenues, interspersed with winding
paths, cascades and fishponds, glowing with flowers and
adorned with statues, whose beauties are redoubled by the
shady foliage, the velvet grass and the perfumes which fill
the air. Directly before the observer the main avenue of the
garden opens the view up the ascent of the sloping ground,
where many terraces rise behind each other in succession, by
broad steps of white marble, on the right and left sides of
the wide avenue, while cascades pour down between them,
in the various forms of broad sheets and broken streams,
intermingled with dark rocks and white statues of animals,
sea-gods and nymphs, and alternately supplying and draining
basins, ponds and small lakes, with grassy or flowery margins,
where swans, gazelles and other harmless creatures
sport in peace. On one of the lakes, formed in the adjacent
fields and groves, is an island, accessible in a ferry-boat,
with a pavilion, where refreshments are in waiting for the
royal visitors; and on the shore of another, a mimic fortress,
with towers, battlements, moats and drawbridges for the
young princes to practise the art of war. Ah! what a
pity that Caserta should so long have been the only spot in
the dominions of Bomba where peace and happiness could
be seen! Had he been as mindful of the rights of his subjects
as of the convenience of his brute favorites, there would
<a id='Page_405'></a>have been no need of the fortifications of Gaeta, the protests
of Europe or the invasion of Garibaldi.</p>

<p class='c007'>A friend and admirer of that great man, while viewing, years
before his arrival, from the upper end of the grand avenue,
this garden and the adjacent "English garden" (which
alone is three miles in circuit), and seeing the campagna
stretching to Naples, with her noble bay beyond, thirty
miles wide, marked by its islands on the west and Vesuvius
on the east, exclaimed: "Oh! this land is worthy of better
masters!" The response to this wish has been recently fulfilled
in a most unexpected manner, by placing the two
Sicilies in the power of the Dictator, and giving him that
splendid palace for his head-quarters during the war in earnest,
which he has so successfully waged against the tyrannical
Bourbon, in one of the last of his strongholds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Late in September was fought the battle of Caserta,
which forced the royal army to retire across the Volturno,
to the fortress and batteries of Capua.</p>
<h4 class='c014'><b>THE BATTLE OF VOLTURNO</b></h4>
<p class='c006'>Was fought on the 1st of October, 1860, and was the
greatest, for the number of troops engaged, in which Garibaldi
ever took part.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both armies knew that Victor Emanuel was approaching
at the head of the Sardinian army, which passed so victoriously
through the papal territories, and was unopposed
in those of Naples; and, while it was the policy of Garibaldi
to wait for his coming before fighting, it was that of the
royalists to gain a victory, if possible, before the arrival of
his powerful reinforcement. The Neapolitan generals had,
therefore, brought together all their available forces, and
supplied the losses caused by sickness and desertion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heights of Sant' Angelo and Bosco di San Vito form
a long range, reaching from the northwest of Caserta toward
the river Volturno, two miles northeast of Capua, passing to
<a id='Page_406'></a>the left of the plain of Santa Maria. This range descends
precipitously to the rapid and narrow Volturno, leaving room
only for the road toward the Scafa di Carazzo. It commands
the country around and has much brushwood, while there
are many trees on the plain. Garibaldi often examined
this ground; and he erected several batteries to sweep the
road on the opposite bank; dug a trench near the shore to
cover riflemen, and brought barges from Naples to cross
with if necessary. There he stationed several corps of
troops. The left flank and communication with Santa
Maria were rather exposed. On the right the position was
pretty well guarded by the ground and the troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The positions formed a semicircle of nearly thirty miles
along the hills to Limatola by the river's course, and then
curving back. Along the chord of this arc, nearly ten miles
long, lie Santa Maria, Caserta and Maddaloni.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"October 1st at dawn," writes an officer, "the Neapolitan army of forty
or fifty thousand men, who were strongly fortified in the fortress
of Capua opposite, and its numerous outworks, attacked all parts
of this line at once. But, before that hour, Garibaldi had left Caserta
by railroad for the line. When he arrived, the firing had already
begun. The three places, Capua, Santa Maria, and the Spur of St.
Angelo, form almost an equilateral triangle, which is indicated by the
three roads which connect these places. They run with little curves
almost straight—that from Capua to St. Angelo, close to the river;
that from Capua to Santa Maria, parallel to the railway; and that from
Santa Maria to St. Angelo, at some distance from the hills till close
to this latter place, where it is joined by the road coming from Capua.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"This triangle, which is in most parts thickly wooded with olive,
and other trees, and has only few open spots, the Neapolitans had
chosen as their field of operations on our left, and as the chief attack
of the day. During the night all the troops stationed in the Polygon
behind had passed through the town and had collected in the Campo,
a large open space before the fortress. Here they opened out in two
directions—one column, the left, toward St. Angelo, and the right
toward Santa Maria.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"I shall first speak of the left column. Besides the great road from
Capua, alongside the river, there is a by-road, which, leaving the main
<a id='Page_407'></a>road at a little distance from the town, strikes across the country and
goes straight toward the village of St. Angelo, which lies on the
retreating slopes of the heights. This was chosen by the Neapolitans
as the centre of their operations against this point, while they sent
one column by the main road toward the right, and another to the
right across the country to take the village in the other flank.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The by-road which runs direct from Capua to St. Angelo, intersects
the road from Santa Maria to the river, just where the road turns
up to St. Angelo. In order to guard this position a barricade was
constructed a little beyond this point, and armed with four guns.
The country near the river is so low that every morning the exhalations
of the ground cover it with a thick white mist. Besides this,
the torrents which come down from the hills have artificial beds of 15
to 20 feet in depth, very steep, and covered with brushwood, which
are dry now, and serve as roads. The Neapolitans, advancing by
these, and taking advantage of the mist, approached quite close to
the barricade, and carried it at the first onset, driving our men across
the main road toward St. Angelo. Having taken this position, they
came out and formed in an open field which lies along the road, in
regular order of battle. Their left had been equally successful, driving
ours from the trench near the river, and forcing them back on the
heights of St. Angelo. The column to the right again had not only
passed the road, but had gone up a little hill commanding St. Angelo.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"It was at this critical moment that Garibaldi arrived. He had
taken, with his staff, carriages at Santa Maria, and was coming on in
the main road toward St. Angelo. The balls and grape were flying
about, but the carriages still proceeded. When they arrived in the
neighborhood of St. Angelo they were in sight of the Neapolitans, who
were drawn up there in line of battle. Fortunately, close to this spot
was one of the torrents dammed, which formed a covered way. In
this the carriages turned down, except the last, which was struck by
a cannon ball, and remained on the road. Through the road Garibaldi
advanced, revolver in hand, toward St. Angelo, and arrived
just in time to give new courage to the defenders. The object was to
drive away the column in the rear of the hills to the left of St.
Angelo; this was easily done by throwing some skirmishers on the
heights above those occupied by the intruders. There was, fortunately,
some artillery in front, which was turned to good account, but
as usual, it was the bayonet which decided. The Neapolitans tried to
penetrate by a cavalry attack, but were beaten back, chiefly by the
coolness of the Calabrese, who behaved splendidly. After three or
four hours' fighting, whatever could be got together of available men
<a id='Page_408'></a>were carried forward, and the Neapolitans not only driven back from
their position on the great road, but likewise the barricades retaken.
This was about nine o'clock.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"During this time the fight had been equally hot at Santa Maria.
General Milvitz, who commanded there, was obliged to confine his
defence to the immediate vicinity of the town, holding the main road
to Capua and the space between it and the railway. Some light
earthworks which he had thrown up lately were of good service. But
the enemy brought up fresh and fresh troops, which he kept in reserve
in the Campo before Capua. The shells and shot flew into the houses
of Santa Maria, and the inhabitants left in masses. Dispatch after
dispatch was sent to Caserta, where the reserve was, to ask for
reinforcements. But the reinforcements were likewise claimed on another
side. Early in the morning a column had shown itself toward Castel
Morone, but was easily driven back, and did not renew its attack.
More serious was the advance against Maddaloni, where a column of
four thousand or five thousand men attacked Bixio. It was a hard
fight, for there were not more than two thousand to two thousand
five hundred men to oppose on a long line where the hills had to be
kept on both sides. But the struggle was soon decided. By noon
the news came that the enemy had not only been driven back from
their position, but had likewise been followed up to the river. A part
of their forces were cut off, and threw themselves into the mountains
between Caserta and Maddaloni.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Then there was a little breathing time, at least on our side, and the
whole effort could be directed against Capua. There were but two
brigades remaining in reserve, both weakened by detachments sent in
different directions. The first was sent on by rail; the second went by
the road, and both arrived almost at the same time, about one <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>
And it was time. The Neapolitan bullets and balls were coming freely
into Santa Maria, while Garibaldi sent orders to let any disposable
troops advance as quickly as possible toward St. Angelo. The
defence of Santa Maria was quite confined to the outskirts of the
town, where the Piedmontese artillerymen were behaving beautifully.
The first thing was to oppose this, and a battalion of Bersaglieri and
one of the regiments of the Brigade Eber, were sent to advance, while
the Brigade Milano was sent by the Porta St. Angelo to take the
enemy on the left flank. But before this occurred, the newly-formed
Hungarian Hussars had been sent out by the Porta Capua to drive
back the enemy's cavalry, which ranged close to the gate. Although
not more than sixty horsemen, they charged and drove back the two
squadrons, cutting them down and taking a number of prisoners.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_409'></a><span class='small'>"The infantry soon followed, and General Turr took the command
of that side. Although mostly fresh troops, with the exception of the
<i>cadres</i>, composed of the Cacciatori of the first expedition, they went
on like old soldiers. The enemy, who had evidently all day long the
idea of intimidating our troops with his cavalry, charged: but the
Picciotti, guided by the soldiers of Calata Fimi, formed groups, and not
only stood firing, but bayoneted the horsemen. After this it was
almost nothing but advance with the bayonet, till the Convent of the
Capuchins and the Cemetery, the two chief positions of the Neapolitans,
were permanently taken.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"While this was going on on that side, the rest of the Brigade
Eber, the last reserve, was called by the Dictator toward St. Angelo.
Scarcely out of the gates, it fell in with Garibaldi, who, accompanied
only by a few officers, was waiting for further reinforcements to fall
on the flank of the enemy, who, on withdrawing from St. Angelo,
had taken to the woods, and occupied some houses with his artillery.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"After the first defeat in the morning, the enemy had returned
with new forces to carry St. Angelo. Not only did all his field guns
scatter death in every direction, but likewise three batteries from the
opposite bank, and the mortars from the fortress, began to open a
tremendous fire, under the protection of which the Neapolitans advanced
between 10 and 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> They carried once more the position
of the barricade, and occupied even the first houses leading up toward
St. Angelo. Medici and Col. Spangaro, besides Garibaldi, did
everything to steady the wavering troops, who, seeing themselves so
much outnumbered, and attacked by such formidable artillery, began
to think the day lost. For hours the fight lasted, a continual advance
or retreat on both sides, but still the Neapolitans could not gain
much ground. This was, perhaps, the most strongly contested spot
on the whole line, and only in the afternoon the advantage began to
show on our side. The Neapolitans had again to clear the road, but
they still held our barricade and the woods on both sides of it. With
great trouble two skirmishing lines were formed, and sent to threaten
their left and right, and then a hundred men were collected behind
the first house, and these made a rush, at the cry of 'Viva Garibaldi!'
and carried the position about 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, which was kept, as well
as the guns which were in it.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi returned to Santa Maria and brought on the rest of the
Brigade Eber to complete the success which had been gained.
Scarcely half a mile from Santa Maria, an open space lies on the left
of the road, through which a detached barrack is visible. Here the
<a id='Page_410'></a>Neapolitans had placed some guns, while their infantry lined the
woods. As soon as they saw the column, they opened fire. Garibaldi,
not heeding, still advanced, until he came to the first body.
Here he gave orders to the Hungarian legion and the Swiss company
to advance and drive them away. The two threw themselves into
the woods, and, scarcely using their arms, advanced with the bayonet,
driving the Neapolitans before them like sheep. A cavalry charge
of several squadrons followed, and did a good deal of harm to the
little body of brave fellows, but did not hinder them from following
up their success and pushing forward to the very edge of the Campo
before Capua.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi still advanced with the few remaining companies in the
direction of St. Angelo, sending off one after another to continue the
work of the Hungarians. Medici had, in the meantime, also pushed in
advance, and by 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> the Neapolitans were flying in all directions,
and our men had occupied the edge of the wood at half a mile
from Capua, where they remained all night.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"It was as complete a defeat as ever an army suffered.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"They had on the whole line quite 30,000, to which we could
scarcely oppose 15,000.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The losses were not so serious as might have been expected.
Many wounded, but few dead.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The column which was cut off by Bixio showed about Caserta,
and next morning Garibaldi went to give them the finishing stroke.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"We have five guns which were left by the Neapolitans early in
the day, but could only be secured toward evening. Two British
sailors distinguished themselves in removing them."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The king's troops had erected strong defensive works along
the right bank of the Volturno, where they had, besides the
formidable fortress of Capua, on the margin of the water,
every favorable point occupied with forts or batteries. They
entirely commanded the river, which is there only a ditch,
with bridges crossing from the castle. From San Clemente
to Cajazzo their bank was covered with well masked batteries,
redoubts and barricades of trees; while the low parts
of the shore were full of impediments and dangerous, concealed
obstructions; and the whole was supplied with
numerous chosen troops, well intrenched, excited by the
promise of rewards.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_411'></a>We here translate <i>Garibaldi's Order of the Day</i>, after the
battle of Volturno:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"On the 1st of October, a fatal and fratricidal day, when Italians
fought, on the Volturno, against Italians, with all the energy which
man displays against man; the bayonets of my companions in arms
found also on that occasion the victory in their gigantic footsteps.
With equal valor they fought and conquered at Maddaloni, St.
Angelo and Santa Maria. With equal valor the courageous champions
of Italian independence led their brave men to the conflict.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"At Castel Morone, Bronzetti, a worthy rival of his brother, at the
head of a handful of Cacciatori, repeated one of those deeds which
history will surely place by the side of the combats of Leonidas and
the Fabii. Few, but splendid with the crown of valor, the Hungarians,
French and English, who attended the southern army,
worthily sustained the martial fame of their countrymen. Favored
by fortune, I have had the honor, in the two worlds, of fighting
against the first soldiers; and I have become convinced that <i>the
plant Man grows in Italy not inferior to any country</i>; I have been
made to believe that these same soldiers whom we have fought in
southern Italy would not be placed behind the most warlike, when
assembled under the glorious standard of emancipation.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"At dawn on that day, I arrived at Santa Maria from Caserta, by
the railroad. While entering the coach for St. Angelo, Gen.
Milwitz said to me: 'The enemy have attacked my outposts of San
Tamaro.' Suddenly, beyond Santa Maria, toward St. Angelo, was
heard a lively fusilade; and near the posts of the left of the said
position, they were powerfully engaged with the enemy. A coachman
and a horse of the coaches in my train were killed. I might,
however, pass freely, thanks to the bravery of the Simonetta brigade,
Division Medici, which occupied that point, and courageously repulsed
the enemy. I thus reached the crossing of the Capua and Santa
Maria roads, the centre of the position of St. Angelo, and there were
the Generals Medici and Avezzana, who, with their accustomed
courage and coolness, made their arrangements to repel the enemy,
breaking in upon their whole line. I said to Medici, 'I am going
alone to observe the field of battle. Defend the position at any
cost.' I had hardly proceeded toward the heights behind, when I
found the enemy were masters of them. Without loss of time, I collected
all the soldiers at hand, and placing myself on the left of the
ascending enemy, I endeavored to prevent them. I sent, at the same
time, a company of Genoese Bersaglieri toward Mount St. Nicolas, to
<a id='Page_412'></a>prevent the enemy from gaining possession of it. That company and
two of the Sacchi brigade, which I had demanded, and which
made their appearance opportunely on the heights, arrested the
enemy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Then moving myself toward the right, on their line of retreat,
the enemy began to descend and fly. Not until some time afterward,
I learned that a corps of the enemy's Cacciatori, before their attack
in front, had got to our rear by a covered way, without being known.
In the mean time, the battle was warm on the plain of St. Angelo,
now favorable to us, and then compelling us to retire before so
numerous and tenacious an enemy. For several days unequivocal
signs had announced to me an attack; and therefore I was not left
to be deceived by the different demonstrations of the enemy against
our right and left; and this was of much importance, because the
royalists had collected all their disposable forces against us on the
first of October, and attacked us simultaneously in all our positions.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"At Maddaloni, after varying fortune, the enemy had been
repulsed. At St. Maria equally; and at both points they had left
prisoners and cannon. The same happened at St. Angelo, after a
fight of more than six hours; but, our forces at that point being very
inferior to those of the enemy, he had remained, with a strong
column, master of the communications between St. Angelo and St.
Maria. I was, therefore, obliged, in order to get to the reserve
which I had asked of General Sistori from Caserta, to pass to the east
of the road leading from St. Angelo to the latter point. I reached
St. Maria near 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and there found our troops commanded by the
brave general Milwitz, who had bravely repulsed the enemy at all
points. The reserves sent for from Caserta reached us at that moment;
and I placed them in column of attack on the St. Angelo
road; the Milan brigade, at the head, followed by the brigade Eber;
and I ordered in reserve part of the brigade Assanti. I then pressed
to the attack the brave Calabrians of Pace, who were in a wood on
my right, and fought splendidly. The head of the column had
hardly issued from the wood, about 8 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, when it was discovered
by the enemy, who began to fire grape. This caused a little confusion
among the young Milanese Bersaglieri, who marched in front;
but those brave soldiers, at the sound of charge from the trumpets,
rushed upon the enemy, who had begun to retire toward Capua.
The lines of the Milanese Bersaglieri were soon followed by a battalion
of the same brigade, which fearlessly charged the enemy without
firing a shot.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The road from St. Maria to St. Angelo forms, in the direction of
<a id='Page_413'></a>St. Maria to Capua, an angle of about forty degrees; so that, while
the column was proceeding along the road, it must always be on the
left, and alternate forward. When, therefore, the Milanese brigade
and the Calabrians were engaged, I sent forward the brigade Eber
against the enemy on the right of the former. It was fine to see the
veterans of Hungary march under fire with the tranquillity of a
parade-ground, and in the same order. Their fearless intrepidity
contributed not a little to the retreat of the enemy. With the movements
in the front of my column and on the right, I soon found myself
joining with the column of Medici, which had bravely sustained
an unequal contest through the whole day. The courageous Genoese
carabiniers, who formed the left of the division Medici, did not wait
for any command to charge the enemy again. They, as always, performed
prodigies of valor. The enemy, after fighting obstinately all
day, toward 5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, reëntered Capua in disorder, protected by the
cannon of the place.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"At evening I had noticed in St. Angelo, that a column of the
enemy of 4,000 or 5,000 men was in Old Caserta. I ordered the
Genoese carabiniers to be ready at two in the morning of October
2d, with 350 men of the corps of Spangaro, and 60 mountaineers of
Vesuvius. I marched at that hour on Caserta by the mountain road
and St. Lencio. Before reaching Caserta, the brave Colonel Missori,
whom I had directed to discover the enemy, with some of his brave
guides, informed me that the royalists were on the heights between
Old Caserta and Caserta, which I was soon able to verify. I went to
Caserta to concert with General Sistori, and not believing the enemy
bold enough to attack that city, I combined with him to collect all
the forces at hand, and march against the enemy's right flank,
and attack him by the heights of the park of Caserta, thus placing
him between us and the division Bixio, which I had ordered to
attack him on that side.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The enemy still held the heights; but discovering only a small
force in Caserta, had projected its capture, ignorant, no doubt, of
the result of the battle of the previous day, and, therefore, pushed
half his force upon that city. While I was thus marching under cover,
on the right flank of the enemy, he attacked Caserta in front, and
would, perhaps, have gained it, if General Sistori, with his accustomed
bravery, and a band of valorous men, had not repulsed him.
With the Calabrians of General Stocco and four companies of the
northern army, I proceeded against the enemy, who was charged—resisted
but little, and was driven almost at a run to Old Caserta.
There a small number of the enemy sustained themselves for a moment,
<a id='Page_414'></a>firing from windows, but they were soon surrounded and made prisoners.
Those who fled in advance fell into the hands of the soldiers of
Bixio, who, after fighting bravely on the first at Maddaloni,
arrived on the field of battle like lightning. Those who remained
behind capitulated with Sacchi, whom I had ordered to follow the
movement of my column; so that, of all the enemy's corps, few were
able to escape. This corps, it appears, was the same which had
attacked Bronzetti at Castel Morono—and that his heroic defence,
with his handful of brave soldiers, had restrained them the greater
part of the day, thus preventing them from getting into the rear all
that day. The corps of Sacchi also contributed to detain that column
beyond the Park of Caserta on the first day by repulsing it bravely.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>"<span class='sc'>Caserta</span>, <i>October</i>, 1860."</p>
<p class='c006'>GARIBALDI'S PERSONAL HEROISM.</p>
<p class='c006'>A correspondent of the Paris "Journal des Débats" says:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The most brilliant episode of the action of the 1st of October was
the recapture of the battery at the foot of Mont St. Angelo. When
I left Santa Maria, I knew that this battery had been very much disabled
in the morning. Garibaldi arrived at nine o'clock, when the enemy was
thundering at it with all his strength, because it took him in flank,
and was causing him severe loss. The triple battery courageously
resisted the attack, and never slackened fire, when all at
once the one situated at the foot of the hill became silent. The
royalists, to the number of 2,500, got round the hill, and rushing
upon the guns, spiked five of them, and killed several of the men at
their pieces. Garibaldi, on the San Tannaro side, soon observed
the silence of his favorite battery, and an aid-de-camp from General
Milwitz soon informed him of the disaster, which would probably have
lost him the battle. Garibaldi at once started off, crossed Santa
Maria, followed by Medici and his staff, and collecting what men he
could, cried out in a voice which caused all to shudder, 'We are
going to die, but the Italians must win the day: at all other points we
have conquered.' Followed by one hundred men, at a rapid pace,
Garibaldi leading the way in a small, disabled carriage, went right
forward. But just as they got near the Casino of St. Angelo, some
Neapolitan Chasseurs, who were lying on the ground, rose and fell
upon them. The coachman drove his horses into a ditch and formed
a barricade of the carriage. Garibaldi jumped up, indignant, and
went up to the Chasseurs, shouting, 'Viva Italia!' Some of his men
<a id='Page_415'></a>coming up at the same time, the enemy became demoralized and took
to flight. Garibaldi was slightly wounded in the stomach, and his
trousers were riddled by two or three bullets. 'If I only had another
pair,' he said, and without further remark he continued his march
toward a battalion of one hundred and fifty Hungarians, commanded
by General Mogyorady. He pointed to the Neapolitans who were in
possession of the battery, and cried out to them, 'Forward, my lads,
disperse that rabble for me!' This 'rabble' consisted of a regiment
of the line, a squadron of Cavalry, a company of Chasseurs, and a
company of Artillery. The Hungarians, without waiting to count the
numbers of the adversary, rushed forward and charged with the
bayonet. After a contest of twenty minutes, the battery was retaken,
and once more it poured its storm of grape on the Neapolitan troops,
who fled in confusion across the fields. The Hungarians, in this
encounter, had thirty men put <i>hors de combat</i>, the Neapolitans
about two hundred. Garibaldi did not wait to dress his wound, but
hurried elsewhere. The day, however, was now won."</span></p>

<p class='c006'>We must now leave Garibaldi for a time, and devote a chapter
to the affairs of the Pope and Sardinia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Emperor of the French and Victor Emanuel had
long since advised and urged the Pope to dismiss his foreign
troops, with which he garrisoned his fortresses, and not only
kept the people in awe, but oppressed them intolerably; but
he, under the influence of his prime minister, Antonelli, stubbornly
refused, as well as persisted in denying every proposition
for the removal of abuses. Adhering to the old and
impious claim of divine right, as the vicegerent of God on
earth, and hoping, no doubt, that Austria would be able to
come to his aid with her armies, when every intelligent eye
<a id='Page_417'></a>saw that Austria was hardly able to stand alone, the pope
had excommunicated Victor Emanuel, and even Louis
Napoleon in fact, though without naming him, at a time
when the latter was still upholding with his army the papal
power in Rome, which he had restored by besieging that
city in 1849. There was an abundance of inconsistencies
and self-contradictions on all sides; and it would have been
difficult to point out any way in which either of the three
sovereigns could consistently move, speak or even stand still.
But good men rejoice when good is done, and sometimes
the more when it is effected in an unexpected quarter.
In 1849 the Roman republic was overthrown by French cannon,
though created by the free suffrage of the Pope's subjects;
and, in 1860, most of the Pope's territory and fortresses
were to be captured in siege and battle, in order to
drive out foreign troops, whose presence was "an insult
to Italy," and to allow the inhabitants freedom to vote for
annexation to Piedmont.</p>

<p class='c007'>England had often protested to the kings of Naples
against their inhumanity toward their subjects; and thus she
was prepared to approve, as she has done, of the invasions
of her territory by Garibaldi and Victor Emanuel.</p>

<p class='c007'>We can find here but little space to notice the events
which followed the Pope's final refusal to accede to the
demands made upon him. How unreasonable soever they
appeared to him, or however inconsistent they may have
seemed to the world, especially the appeal to free, universal
suffrage, which would be hardly submitted to in any other
country in Europe, no alternative was left.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the iniquitous overthrow of the republic by Louis,
the occupation of Rome by his army in fact conciliated the
entire papal priesthood of the world, and the population
which has remained under their spiritual influence; and it
has prevented Austria not only from taking that place, but
of every excuse and possibility of aspiring to obtain it.
While the Pope has been surrounded by French troops, he
<a id='Page_418'></a>has appeared to be under safe guardianship, even although
during the few months which have passed since the fulmination
of the Bull of Excommunication against Victor Emanuel,
Louis Napoleon himself has also been, by plain innuendo, laid
<i>under the ban</i> by the same instrument, and has been transformed
from "the eldest son of the church—the beloved in
Christ," as the Pope used to denominate him, to an enemy,
delivered over to Satan, and anathematized, in every part
and member of his soul and body, from the crown of his
head to his accursed feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now things have changed wonderfully, and we have
indications that the French emperor is about to change his
position accordingly. If events take such a course as we
may anticipate, the Pope's temporal power will soon be
entirely gone, and his respectability in the eyes of the world
will be only such and so much as can be bought with two
millions of dollars a year, and by a train of cardinals, with
ten thousand dollars apiece. This is the plan now proposed
for the future position of Pius IX., which Victor Emanuel
seems likely to carry into operation, with the approbation
of Louis Napoleon. There is now no longer any danger from
Austria, weak as she is by bankruptcy, the loss of most of
her Italian possessions, threatened with the invasion of the
remainder by Garibaldi on "the ides of March," and with
Hungary ready to rise at the first signal. The Italians can
now take charge of the Pope and of Rome, without fear of
Austria or assistance from France; and, either before any
more fighting in Lombardy and Venetia, or, if need be, after
it, the kingdom of all Italy is likely to be proclaimed,
according to Garibaldi's announcement, from the Quirinal,
one of the seven hills of Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this shall have been done, the anticipations of the
Italian patriots will be realized, who have long regarded the
loss of the Pope's temporal kingdom as surely involving the
destruction of his spiritual; and many of them were early
advocates of the doctrine preached by Gioberti twenty
<a id='Page_419'></a>years ago, although he was a devotee of popery and they
were its radical enemies, because they had sagacity to foresee
the necessity of this act, which was beyond his perception.
They knew full well, what millions of the unwilling subjects
of the papacy have known for centuries, that nothing but
severe and cruel oppression could ever keep the human mind
submissive to such a system of tyranny, spiritual and physical,
and that, whenever force and fear were removed, individuals,
communities and nations would throw off the galling
and degrading yoke. This the world has seen proved within
the past few months, in ways and modes, in a degree and to
an extent, which only those who were acquainted with popery,
with human nature and with Italy would have expected. As
soon as freedom of speech and action was granted to the
people of Lombardy, the Duchies, Tuscany and Emilia, and
a free, universal suffrage was proclaimed, the inhabitants
rose in a mass in city, villages and country, and proceeded,
with banners, music and acclamations, to the election urns,
and voted unanimously for immediate annexation to the constitutional
kingdom of Victor Emanuel. And this expression
of the universal and enthusiastic popular will was greatly
enhanced by the circumstance that the king had just before
been excommunicated by a Bull of the Pope, which consigned
him to outlawry, persecution, torture and death in
this world, and to eternal misery in hell; and yet many
Italian archbishops, bishops and priests, of all degrees, have
openly approved the rejection of allegiance to the papacy,
and urged and even led their people to the polls, themselves,
in many instances, putting in the first votes.</p>

<p class='c007'>But not only have the hopes of good Italian patriots been
gratified: the prophecies of God himself have been fulfilled,
by the recent astonishing course of events in Italy. So
striking is the resemblance between those changes and the
scenes recorded in the Bible, that the mind is filled with
solemn awe and grateful adoration while contemplating them
<a id='Page_420'></a>in comparison. "The souls under the altar" introduced to
the reader of the book of Revelation, with their purity,
faithfulness, patience, but earnest inquiry: "How long,
O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not avenge our blood?"
how much do they resemble the victims of the Inquisition,
whose horrible secrets were disclosed by the opening of that
infernal edifice in Rome by the republican government in
1849! And how much does the present period resemble
that described in chap. xviii. ver. 13 of that book, where the
destruction of Babylon the Great is described, and one of
whose chief articles of traffic were not "the persons of men,"
as in Tyrus (Ezekiel xxvii.), but their "souls!"</p>

<p class='c007'>And how Garibaldi appears like the agent by whom that
destruction is to be accomplished, when we hear him repeat
his open and tremendous denunciations against the papacy,
now, recently, standing in Naples, almost in the same words
which he wrote in New York in 1850, for this volume, and
recorded on page 233.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the war with Italy the States of the Church were
divided into four legations, not counting the district of
Rome. The first comprised the provinces of Bologna,
Ferrara, Forli and Ravenna, and was called Romagna.
This is the portion which had been already annexed to Piedmont.
The second, which separates the Romagna from the
Neapolitan states, is composed of the provinces of Urbino,
Pesaro, Macerata, Loreto, Ancona, Fermo, Ascoli and
Camerino. It is this portion of the Roman territory which
is commonly known under the name of the Marches, and is
bounded on the north by Romagna, on the east by the
Adriatic, on the south by the Neapolitan territory, and on
the west by the provinces of Spoleto and Perugia. The third
legation was composed of the provinces of Spoleto, Perugia
and Rieti. The first two corresponded to what is generally
known under the name of Umbria. The fourth legation
comprised Velletri, Frosinone and Benevento, the last
<a id='Page_421'></a>province being surrounded by Neapolitan territory. The district
of Rome was placed under a special <i>régime</i>, and consisted
of that city, of Viterbo, Orvieto and Civita Vecchia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The course of policy recently adopted by Sardinia had
now been made known by what was deemed a semi-official
announcement by a Turin gazette, under the direction of
Cavour. It was this: that the cabinet of Turin, in placing
itself in the position of the representative of Italian nationality,
had a right to reproach Austria for not having given
to Venetia, either a separate government or an Italian army.
This violation of the treaty of Villafranca had very naturally
disquieted the Sardinian government, which, however, had
no intention of provoking an imprudent war. On the contrary,
it desired to prevent this, and demanded to this end,
the dismissal of the foreign hordes which had been united
by General Lamoricière. "It cannot be permitted," says
the paper in question, "that Italy should be made the
camping ground of twenty-five thousand foreign mercenaries,
who entertain toward the Italians feelings of hatred and
aversion." The Sardinian government cannot look on with
indifference at the renewal of the massacres of Perugia. It
owes protection to the populations of Umbria and the
Marches, who are subjected to a military dictation which
they hate, and it is better for the government to take the
responsibility of energetic measures, which will be too late if
it waits for the attack. Such was the substance of the article
written while the people of Umbria and the Marches were
in a state of insurrection. For, before that time, the following
accounts had been received from different parts of the
Pope's dominions. At Fano, Sinigaglia and Ancona, the
government of Pius IX. were in serious danger. The last-named
town in particular, which had revolted, and had been
brought back to obedience rather by stratagem than by
force, was said to be the centre of agitation and the hotbed
of revolutionary incendiarism. A correspondence had just
been discovered which compromised a great number of
<a id='Page_422'></a>persons. Many had been arrested. It was connected with a
conspiracy, the ramifications of which were said to be so
widespread, and included men so high placed in society, that
the authorities admitted that they were incapable of guarding
against the storm without the assistance of an armed
force. Advocates, officials, private individuals, and even a
certain number of Roman officers, were compromised in the
affair, but no general arrest could be attempted for fear of
leading to a most dangerous collision. The mass of the people
only waited as a signal the arrest of some eminent personages
to rise in insurrection, and the police were well aware
that a large depot of arms existed, but they were ignorant of
the spot. Such was the situation of Ancona, which, it would
appear, regulated the movements of the towns on the coast
of the Adriatic, such as Sinigaglia, Fano and Pesaro, and of
those in the interior, as Osimo, Loretto and Recanati, and
as far as Macerata. In this state of things the Roman
government had just ordered troops to proceed by forced
marches on Ancona from Pesaro, Perugia and Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length Count Cavour gave notice to the Pope, in the
following letter to Cardinal Antonelli, that he must immediately
decide on what course to pursue.</p>

<p class='c007'>"<span class='sc'>Eminence</span>: <span class='small'>The government of his majesty, the King of Sardinia,
could not without serious regret see the formation and existence
of the bodies of foreign mercenary troops in the pay of the Pontifical
government. The organization of such corps not consisting, as in
all civilized governments, of citizens of the country, but of men of all
languages, nations and religions, deeply offends the public conscience
of Italy and Europe. The want of discipline inherent to such troops,
the inconsiderate conduct of their chiefs, the irritating menaces with
which they pompously fill their proclamations, excite and maintain a
highly dangerous ferment. The painful recollection of the massacre
and pillage of Perugia is still alive among the inhabitants of the
Marches and Umbria. This state of things, dangerous in itself, becomes
still more so after the facts which have taken place in Sicily
and in the kingdom of Naples. The presence of foreign troops,
<a id='Page_423'></a>which insults the national feeling, and prevents the manifestation of
the wishes of the people, will infallibly cause the extension of the
movement to the neighboring provinces. The intimate connection
between the inhabitants of the Marches and Umbria and those of the
provinces annexed to the states of the king, and reasons of order
and security in his own territory, lay his majesty's government under
the necessity of applying, as far as in its power, an immediate remedy
to such evils. King Victor Emanuel's conscience does not permit
him to remain a passive spectator of the bloody repression with
which the arms of the foreign mercenaries would extinguish every
manifestation of national feeling in Italian blood. No government
has the right of abandoning to the will and pleasure of a horde of
soldiers of fortune, the property, the honor and lives of the
inhabitants of a civilized country.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"For these reasons, after having applied to his majesty, the king,
my august sovereign, for his orders, I have the honor of signifying
to your eminence that the king's troops are charged to prevent, in
the name of the rights of humanity, the Pontifical mercenary corps
from repressing by violence the expression of the sentiments of the
people of the Marches and Umbria. I have, moreover, the honor to
invite your excellency, for the reasons above explained, to give
immediate orders for the disbanding and dissolving of those corps,
the existence of which is a menace to the peace of Italy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Trusting that your eminence will immediately communicate to
me the measures taken by the government of his holiness in the
matter, I have the honor of renewing to your eminence the expression
of my high consideration.</span></p>
<div class='c011'>"<span class='sc'>Cavour.</span>"</div>
<p class='c006'>The following is the reply of Cardinal Antonelli:</p>
<div class='c033'>"<span class='sc'>Rome</span>, <i>Sept. 11</i>.</div>
<p class='c012'>"<span class='sc'>Excellency</span>: <span class='small'>Without taking into account the manner in
which your Excellency has thought proper to have your letter of the
7th inst. conveyed to me, I have directed my whole attention calmly
upon the subject you lay before me in the name of your sovereign,
and I cannot conceal from you that it has cost me an extraordinary
effort to do so. The new principles of public law which you lay
down in your letter, would be, indeed, sufficient to dispense me
from giving any answer at all, they being so contrary to those which
have constantly been acknowledged by all governments and nations.
Nevertheless, feeling deeply the inculpations cast upon the government
of his holiness, I cannot refrain from at once noticing the blame,
<a id='Page_424'></a>as odious as it is unfounded and unjust, pronounced against the
troops belonging to the Pontifical government, and I must add, that
I find the pretension of denying the right belonging to the Pontifical
government as well as to any other, of having foreign troops in its
service, utterly unjustifiable. In fact, many governments of Europe
have foreign troops in their pay. On that subject it may be expedient
to observe that, owing to the character with which the Sovereign
Pontiff is invested as the common father of all believers, he
ought to be less subject to criticism than any other for receiving in
the ranks of his troops all who come and offer themselves from the
various parts of the Catholic world, for the defence of the Holy See,
and of the States of the Church.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"Nothing is more false or insulting than to attribute to the Pontifical
troops the disorders which have taken place in the states of
the Holy See. There is no necessity for asking, for history has
already enregistered whence came the troops who have violently
constrained the will of the people, and the artifices which have been
made use of for throwing into perturbation the greater part of Italy,
and ruining all that was most inviolable and most sacred, both in
right and in justice.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"As to the consequences which it has been sought to make weigh
on the legitimate action of the troops of the Holy See, to put down
the rebellion of Perugia, it would truly be more logical to throw that
responsibility on those who, from abroad, have excited the revolt;
and you know perfectly well, M. le Comte, where that outbreak was
concerted, whence were derived money, arms and means of all kinds,
and whence instructions and orders were sent to the insurgents.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"There is, consequently, reason for representing as calumnious all
that has been said by a party hostile to the government of the Holy
See, as to the conduct of its troops, and for declaring that the
imputations cast on their chiefs by the authors of proclamations of a
nature to excite dangerous ferments, are not less. Your excellency
concludes your painful dispatch by inviting me, in the name of
your sovereign, to immediately order the disarming and disbanding
of the said troops. This invitation was accompanied by a sort of
menace on the part of Piedmont in case of refusal, to prevent the
action of said troops by means of the royal troops.</span></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='small'>"This involves a <i>quasi</i> injunction which I willingly abstain from
qualifying. The Holy See could only repel it with indignation,
strong in its legitimate rights, and appealing to the law of nations,
under the ægis of which Europe has hitherto lived, whatever violence
the Holy See may be exposed to suffer, without having provoked it,
<a id='Page_425'></a>and against which it is my duty now to protest energetically in the
name of his holiness. With sentiments of consideration, I am, etc.,</span></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The occupation of the Roman States by the King of Sardinia
was one of the most important and unexpected steps in
the war, which soon followed the preceding announcement.
The above note was sent by Count Cavour to Cardinal
Antonelli, minister of the Pope, in compliance with the
urgent demand of the people of Umbria and the Marches,
in which the Sardinian government had demanded the immediate
dismissal of the papal mercenaries, affirming that the
presence of upward of 20,000 foreign troops in the centre of
Italy was incompatible with the treaty of Villafranca. The
note threatened that unless this demand should be agreed to
in 24 hours, the Sardinian army would enter those territories.
No reply was received within that time, and then Victor
Emanuel issued the following proclamation:</p>

<p class='c007'>"<span class='sc'>Soldiers</span>: <span class='small'>You enter the Marches and Umbria to restore civil
order in their desolated cities, and to afford the people the
opportunity of expressing their wishes. You have not to combat powerful
armies, but to free unhappy Italian provinces from foreign bands of
mercenaries. You go not to avenge the injuries done to me and to Italy,
but to prevent the bursting forth of popular hatred and vengeance
against misrule. You will teach, by your example, forgiveness of
injuries, and Christian tolerance to him who in his folly has compared
to Islamism our love for our country, Italy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"At peace with all the great powers, and without any idea of
provocation, I intend to remove from the centre of Italy a perpetual
source of disturbance and discord. I desire to spare the seat of the
head of the church, to whom I am ready, in accord with allied and
friendly powers, to give all those guarantees for independence and
security which his blind counsellors have vainly imagined they could
obtain from the fanaticism of that mischievous party that conspires
against my authority and the liberty of the nation.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Soldiers; They accuse me of ambition! Yes! one ambition is
mine—that of restoring to Italy the principles of moral order and of
preserving Europe from the continual peril of revolution and of
war.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_426'></a>Before the middle of September, General Cialdini had
taken the town of Pesaro, and captured twelve hundred of
the German troops, being a portion of those bands of foreign
soldiers, against the keeping of which France and Piedmont
had so long protested, and the retaining of which was the
chief ground of the war. Orvieto was also taken. Fossombrone
had risen in insurrection, as Pesaro had done before
Cialdini's arrival; but Fossombrone, being unsupported, had
been reduced to obedience, by such savage punishment as
had been suffered by Perugia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The "London Times" remarked, on receiving this news,
and in reviewing the manifesto of Victor Emanuel:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"We freely admit that nothing but the extremity of the evil could
justify the step which Sardinia has taken, but we think that step is
justified. The evil would not cure itself. For all these reasons, we
think the King of Sardinia is entitled to the sympathy of Englishmen
in the war in which he has engaged. We wish him cordially success,
and that his success may be rapid as well as decisive."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>The war, in fact, was begun by the rulers and their hired
butchers against the people, before the Sardinian troops
crossed the frontier. The presence of those troops was also
an insult to Italy, as their express object was to oppose the
movement in the free territories. The same writer added the
following remarks:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Then there is the intolerable oppression of the Pope's government.
The best proof of that oppression is the fact that the Pope dares not
trust his own subjects with arms, but places himself, like Dionysius of
Syracuse, in the hands of foreign mercenaries. The spectacle of a
people kept down by such means is an outrage on the civilization of
the age, and a danger and menace for all the rest of Italy. Till some
government be established in the centre of Italy, which can be
maintained without ten thousand French troops to garrison the capital,
and five and twenty thousand foreign mercenaries to sack insurgent
towns, it is in vain to hope for peace."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>General Cialdini approached Ancona, and a naval squadron
was to coöperate. The battle of Castelfidaro was
<a id='Page_427'></a>fought on the 18th of September, when Lieut. General
Cialdini was furiously attacked by General Lamoricière, with
eleven thousand men and one hundred and forty cannon.
Four thousand other papal troops made a sortie from Ancona,
to support the latter. The contest was short but
bloody. Many of the wounded papists used their daggers
against the Piedmontese, who went to assist them. The results,
said Cialdini's report, were as follows:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"The junction of Lamoricière's forces with Ancona has been prevented;
we have taken six hundred prisoners, among whom are more
than thirty officers, some of them of high rank; we have taken six
guns, among others those given by Charles Albert to the Pope in
1848, one standard, and numerous ammunition wagons, etc. All the
wounded, including General Pimodan, who led the attacking column,
are in our hands, and a great number of killed."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>General Cialdini conceded the honors of war to this corps,
and officers and men were allowed to return to their homes.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Lamoricière, accompanied by a few horsemen, fled
from the field of battle on the 18th, and, following the road
by the sea through the defiles of Conero, succeeded in reaching
Ancona. All the prisoners and troops were indignant at
his conduct. Nothing remained of Lamoricière's army except
the troops shut up in Ancona; all the rest were in the
hands of the royal troops, with the exception of two thousand
men dispersed in the mountains. The Sardinian government
offered to the English government to set all the Irish prisoners
at liberty. The latter sent a courteous reply, leaving
it entirely to the Sardinian government to take such resolutions
as it might deem most suitable. The Sardinian government
ordered the release of all Frenchmen taken prisoners
from Lamoricière.</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"The mercenary army of General Lamoricière (as the "London
Times" remarked) was the last hope of the Pope. Lamoricière, whom
the last accounts had described as seeking a junction with the Royalist
Neapolitan troops, and threatening a southward movement upon the
Garibaldians, had appeared suddenly before Ancona. Cialdini accepted
the offered battle, and the event has been that the African
<a id='Page_428'></a>general was totally and entirely routed. Those bands, from whom so
much was expected, seem to be of no avail whatever against the Sardinian
soldiers. This fire-eating and pious soldado, who had fulminated
such dreadful threats, and who was known to have done such
strong deeds among the Arabs, has really done nothing in Italy which
might not have been done by one of the College of Cardinals. With
eleven thousand men, and the vigorous aid of the garrison of Ancona,
he has simply marched up to a signal defeat."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Ancona was soon after besieged, blockaded, bombarded,
and captured. The Sardinian navy and army displayed great
skill as well as discipline and courage in this operation. The
particulars of this must be omitted, as well as most others
connected with the march of Victor Emanuel on his triumphant
course toward Naples.</p>

<p class='c007'>The city of Spoleto was besieged and soon taken. The
besieged had three guns, two on a platform above, overlooking
the town, and one below, placed in an embrasure on the
left of the outer gate of the <i>enceinte</i>, so as to command the
road leading up to it. They were iron guns of no great
range, but still serviceable. The smallest of the three, in
the embrasure by the gate, was the only one that did any
execution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Piedmontese arrived at Spoleto in the morning.
They were between two thousand and three thousand strong,
and had one battery of field artillery, consisting of six guns.
The fact is, that the whole thing was a farce; there was very
little attack, and still less defence. The report of the commandant
of Spoleto is an enormous exaggeration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Piedmontese, on their part, did not press the siege
with much vigor. The Italians were positively disaffected,
and threatened their foreign comrades to blow up the powder
magazine if they did not give in. Most of the Irish asked
nothing better than to escape from the service and from the
country, and the rest of the garrison—the motley crew of
German, French, Swiss, and Belgians—they were few in
number and of little worth. The whole loss of the Piedmontese
<a id='Page_429'></a>was, according to the evidence afterward obtained,
under one hundred men. The loss of the garrison is stated
at three killed and ten wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing, certainly, says a visitor, could be more complete
or miserable than the failure and break-down of the Irish
contingent to the Pope's harlequin army. It would be very
unjust, however, to consider this to be in any degree a stain
on the gallant Irish nation, whose impetuous courage and
many excellent military qualities, every one must recognize
and admire. The same ignominious disasters might, and no
doubt would, have fallen to the lot of any body of men, no
matter of what nation, similarly recruited, and deceived, and
neglected, and sent into the field without the training and
education which make the soldier. The shame falls not on
Ireland, but on those who insnared unwilling recruits to prop
a bad cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perugia, which was the scene of an inhuman butchery last
year, committed by some of the horde of foreign wretches
who formed the Pope's army, was now held by about three
thousand of them, who made a strong resistance. The garrison
had raised barricades in all parts of the town, and occupied
the houses, from which they fired upon the Sardinians.
Every street was the scene of a conflict; but the assistance
afforded to General Fanti by the inhabitants made the
struggle much shorter than it would otherwise have been.
A considerable portion of the Pontifical carbineers contrived
to escape out of the town—the others retired to the citadel,
which could not hold out long. Toward evening the fort
capitulated, and the whole of the garrison, consisting of
1,600 men, were made prisoners, as well as General
Schmidt, who commanded them. He was the worthy chief
of the adventurers whom the Italians so cordially detested.
Switzerland refused to acknowledge him. He was one of
the heroes of that impious war of the Sonderbund, which
caused much bloodshed in the Swiss cantons. He was subsequently
exiled.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_430'></a>Victor Emanuel's address to the people of Southern Italy,
dated at Ancona, October 9th, 1860, concludes thus:</p>

<p class='c007'>"<span class='sc'>People of Southern Europe</span>: <span class='small'>My troops are advancing among
you to establish order. I do not come to impose upon you my will,
but to cause yours to be respected. You will be able to manifest it
freely. Providence, which protects just causes, will inspire the vote
which you will deposit in the urn. Whatever be the gravity of
events, I wait tranquilly the judgment of civilized Europe and that of
history, because I have the consciousness of having fulfilled my duty
as king and Italian. In Europe my policy will not be useless in
reconciling the progress of the people with the stability of monarchies.
In Italy I know that I terminate the era of revolutions.</span></p>
<div class='c011'>"<span class='sc'>Victor Emanuel.</span></div>

<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Given at <span class='sc'>Ancona</span>, <i>Oct. 9, 1860</i>."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>In the middle of October Victor Emanuel entered from
the north the kingdom of Naples, which Garibaldi had now
won for him, though by expressly disobeying him, as we have
before seen. The Piedmontese army, approaching by two
columns, was now drawing, as a writer remarked, "the iron
circle, out of which there is no outlet. One column has
already passed Foggia on its way to Benevento and the
Upper Volturno; it has landed at Manfredonia, and is making
its way through the plains of the Capitanata. The other,
under the personal command of the king himself, has landed
at Giulia, and has pushed forward to Pescara, whence a
branch leads into the main road from the north through the
Abruzzi into the rear of Capua.</p>

<p class='c007'>"As for the Piedmontese troops landed at Naples, they
have already taken up their position in line. It was high
time, for the fatiguing service, in the heavy autumnal
rains, with the cold winds, the heavy dews, and chilly mornings,
was fast thinning the ranks. For the most part in the
open air, or with but indifferent huts, constructed of branches
and straw, without camp fires at night, and with continual
alarms, it was a wonder that these young volunteers could
resist as they did."</p>

DECLARES FOR VICTOR EMANUEL—GARIBALDI'S PROCLAMATIONS
—MEETING OF GARIBALDI AND VICTOR EMANUEL.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>And now the short but momentous drama of the year was
drawing rapidly toward its close. Whatever opinions may
be entertained respecting the original intentions of Louis
Napoleon, Victor Emanuel, or their counsellors, or the period
when they were expected to come to their accomplishment,
it seems certain that the steps taken by them not only hastened
the epoch, but secured its success. The world may
perhaps never know what part was performed by individuals
in plans and councils, nor be able to judge of their comparative
merits or abilities. But of Garibaldi we have much
better opportunity to form our opinion, and on most points
there is little room for doubt or misapprehension. One
question still remained to be solved to those who had not
attentively observed his career in former times; and some,
probably, expected to see him ultimately break the promise
which he had made, to resign his power and possessions to
Victor Emanuel; while more, it is natural to believe, expected
to see him claim a high reward, or at least to accept such
splendid honors and permanent powers as the King of Sardinia
would, of course, be ready to bestow. Anxious fears
were expressed, and eager inquiries were made, by many
well-wishers of Italy and admirers of her hero, especially
about the epoch at which we have arrived.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_432'></a>The siege of Capua was pressed. A Scotch gentleman,
who had visited Garibaldi's camp and hospitals, thus wrote
on the 6th of October:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Let any man go to the hospital—what cruel wounds, what horrific
sights! and how cheerfully some of the sufferers bear their troubles.
We have heard much of the noble way in which our English
heroes in the Crimea conducted themselves. Truly many of the common
soldiers of this patriot army might take rank beside them. Again,
as to the officers. If Garibaldi has thought it advisable to break some
of their swords, how many instances can be cited of a heroism in
others which cannot be surpassed. There is a young Sicilian nobleman,
Baron de Cozzo, commonly termed 'The Flower of Sicily,' and
beloved by Garibaldi as a son, now lying cruelly wounded and suffering
in the hospital of Caserta. He had fought untouched all through
the campaign, from Palermo to Capua. He was in the thick of the
battle of the 12th at Capua, and was still unhurt, but he observed a
private of his company in the front struck down wounded; he returned,
put the man on his back, and was carrying him off, when he received
his own wound, and such a one as will most probably render
him a painful cripple the rest of his days, if, indeed, he survives it.
Hundreds of wounded men, and many others mere boys, came into
Naples yesterday, after the battle; and we must reflect how many
more must have fought bravely to render such an account.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Yesterday morning, Captains Smelt and Davidson started early
for the batteries situate on the hills of St. Angelo. On arriving at
the camp at the base of the hill, they joined Lieutenant Cowper, of
Major Pietuni's brigade, and proceeded to the batteries where the guns
had been put into position in order to prevent the royalist army from
getting round to Caserta, as they had previously succeeded in doing.
On gaining the summit of the hill they perceived a body of artillery
with a couple of guns advancing from the right of Cajazzo, with some
cavalry on the left. The officers having been granted the use of the
guns, opened fire upon the enemy as they gradually approached.
Although the first trial shots fell somewhat short, they had the effect
of checking the artillery. The cavalry, however, advanced
notwithstanding, when another shell fell in amongst them, and sent them
flying. Captains Davidson, Smith, and Cowper, finding that they were
now making tolerably good practice, and seeing a house on the other
side of the river where there appeared to be something stirring, they
dropped a shell right into the centre of the said mansion, and out came
the contents like so many bees disturbed in their hive.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_433'></a><span class='small'>"We started this morning for Santa Maria. The havoc amongst the
avenues of trees on the roads shows how severe the contest must have
been.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The view of the field of operations from the top of Mount St.
Angelo toward Capua, is most commanding. Garibaldi, in a round
black hat turned up at the rim, and in a light brown cloak, lined with
Rob Roy tartan, was coming down the hill with his staff, and we joined
in. He held a sort of standing council at the bottom of the hill with
one or two officers who met him, but he spoke so low, that only those
quite close to him could hear a word. We then returned to Caserta
with Colonel Peard, Major Wortley, Captains Sarsfield and Davidson."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>An American gentleman who visited the camp before
Capua, and the Palace of Caserta in October, thus spoke
of them in a letter:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"In company with two English gentlemen and Madame S., of
Naples, I visited the camp before Capua. As we drove down the road
leading to the River Volturno, we reached the extreme point where
the road turned round the base of St. Angelo, when a sentinel stopped
us, saying, 'You are in great danger from the batteries from the other
side, which command the entire road you have just come down, and
they have been firing upon us this morning.' We at once halted,
and sent our carriage back, and under the conduct of one of Garibaldi's
men, ascended the mountain till we reached the summit of the
rising ground, and had a good view of Capua and its defences. While
thus standing at gaze, aided by glasses, a gun was fired from a small
battery we had not before observed on the side of the opposite mountain.
In an instant the ball flew over our heads, and chanced to fall
in the camp beyond, near a group of officers, and killed a horse.
With this notice to quit, we descended and reached the road of St.
Angelo, just as Garibaldi and his staff were ascending, and soon saw
him standing alone on the highest point, scanning the enemy's position
with his glass. One of his aids who had joined us, and who was
known to Madame S., said it was the general's custom to remain for
hours upon the mountain; so we were compelled to give up all hope
of seeing him. As we were walking toward the place where our carriage
was, we were addressed by an English gentleman, such a one
as we have in our minds when we hear the song sung of 'The fine
old English gentleman, all of the olden time.' His dress and bearing
were alike the type of a landed gentleman out of the agricultural
<a id='Page_434'></a>counties. He begged us to avoid the road, as we were within the
range of the enemy's guns. Thanking him for his kindness we left
him, and among our guesses we thought he must be no other than
Colonel Praed, who is to command the English contingent—a regiment
of men just arrived, and who had been that day sent forward as
far as the king's palace at Caserta.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"When we reached the palace, whose magnificent courts and
rooms we found filled with English, we there met this gentleman (Col.
Praed), and asked Lieutenant Campbell, whom we knew, if that was
his colonel. 'Oh no! that gentleman came down with us, and has
offered his services as a private. He has declined a commission, and
will act only with us as a common soldier.' We mixed with the soldiers,
who told us that they were to be sent to the front that night,
and expected to be in action the next day. They were as joyous as
they would have been going out to a May party. While thus occupied,
Lieutenant Campbell called our attention to a lady in a military
costume, just entering the court, attended by a gentleman. Her dress
was a velvet cap, with a feather, a grey suit, the full skirt of which
hung in many folds to her knees. She wore military boots with spurs,
and a sword hung by a waist belt. Her face was handsome—a dark
brunette, with fine flashing eyes. The English clustered around her,
and she addressed them a few words of welcome, whereupon the
cheers of the soldiers made the walls of the palace vocal with strange
music for such a place. The lady was the Countess de la Torre, who
commands a company, and has greatly distinguished herself by her
courage and coolness. In the battle of the 1st instant a shell fell
near her, and those near by, thinking as most persons do at such
times, that 'discretion is the better part of valor,' fell upon their
faces awaiting the bursting, but the countess, following the example
of the great Frederick under similar circumstances, stood with her arms
folded, and when it exploded, she uttered the most fierce reproaches
on those who cowered."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>On the 11th of October, Lord John Russell, in an official
dispatch to the British minister at Turin, declared that
although the Emperor of the French had expressed his displeasure
at the invasion of the Roman territory, the Emperor
of Russia that of Naples, and the Prince of Prussia
had also objected, the British government could see no cause
sufficient for those objections. He closed with these
words:</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_435'></a><span class='small'>"Her majesty's government will turn their eyes rather to the gratifying
prospect of a people building up the edifice of their liberties,
and consolidating the work of their independence, amid the sympathies
and good wishes of Europe. I have, etc.,</span></p>
<div class='c011'>(Signed) "<span class='sc'>J. Russell.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>"P. S.—You are at liberty to give a copy of this dispatch to Count
Cavour.
"To Sir James Hudson, etc., etc."</p>
<p class='c006'>Garibaldi, on the 15th of October, issued the following
proclamation:</p>
<p class='c006'>"<i>Italy and Victor Emanuel!</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"To satisfy a wish cherished by the whole nation, I, the dictator,
decree as follows:</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The Two Sicilies, which have been redeemed by Italian blood,
and which have freely elected me their dictator, form an integral part
of one and indivisible Italy under her constitutional king, Victor
Emanuel, and his descendants.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"On the arrival of the king, I will depose in his hands the dictatorship
conferred upon me by the nation.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The pro-dictators are charged with the execution of the present
decree.</span></p>

<div class='c011'>"<span class='sc'>G. Garibaldi.</span></div>
<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"<span class='sc'>Caserta</span>, <i>Oct. 15</i>."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>After this decree, both parties which had been vying with
each other to destroy Garibaldi, saw that there was an end
to their calculations. His enemies felt that, in spite of all
intrigues and ingratitude, he rose higher than ever at the
moment they thought of crushing him, and his false friends
understood that his noble nature will always find out the
right way, in spite of the abuse which is made of the sacred
name of friendship, to lead him where their interest might
wish him to go. Indeed, this time they fell into their own
snare, for this announcement was accelerated by their last
effort to divert Garibaldi from the right path.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day was now at hand, when an end was to be put to
doubts and fears, and the mouths of calumniators were to be
<a id='Page_436'></a>stopped forever. How can the enemies of Garibaldi look upon
their aspersions without mortification; or even the greater
part of the first journalists of Europe as well as of America,
reperuse their evil prognostications, without a desire to recall
or to make some amends for their unworthy suspicions? How
must the character of Garibaldi rise in the view of those who
were unacquainted with his previous life, and allowed themselves
to attribute to him the weakness of judgment, the
selfish aims, or the uncontrolled passions of common men,
since they have found him exalted far above the ordinary level
of soldiers and statesmen! How must his willful calumniators
turn, not only in bitter disappointment, after the defeat
of their criminal efforts, but with self-loathing, from the
contemplation of a character which makes their perfidy appear
doubly hideous by contrast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can we not imagine, in some just degree, what must have
been the feelings of his own heart, even through the periods
of his greatest darkness, when, independently of the opinions
or fears of friends, and the aspersions and intrigues of foes,
he proceeded on his gigantic task with unshaken resolution,
undeviating step, and unfailing success, from the beginning
to the end? The difficulties, dangers, delays, obstacles and
opponents continually around him, far from overpowering,
impeding or disheartening him, never seemed to agitate or
excite him. Self-possessed, as if in tranquil scenes, he appears
never to have lost, even for a moment, the full exercise of his
judgment or the perfect control of his passions. He entered
every new scene with a consciousness of these extraordinary
faculties, and came out of it confirmed, by new experience, in
his ability to do everything necessary in future. With such
conscious integrity and powers, how lofty must have been his
feelings during every stage of his career; and how exalted
and delightful when he arrived at its close!</p>

<p class='c007'>The contemplation of such a character cannot fail to be
useful as well as delightful to every virtuous mind and heart;
and the new model which he has bequeathed to the world by
<a id='Page_437'></a>his pure and splendid example, must be extensively and long
appreciated, and have great and blessed effects. And one way
in which it must most naturally act, will be by encouraging
men possessing traits like his own, in different spheres of life,
duly to estimate those humble virtues, which have been so
much underrated in our country in late years, because thrust
aside or trampled down by the empty vanity of wealth, or
the impudence of corrupt party power. Indeed, we may
hope that the example of the pure and noble Garibaldi, since
it has been so displayed as to strike all eyes, and to engage all
minds, will impress upon good citizens a sense of the duty
which they have so long neglected, of combining to cast
bad rulers from the seats designed for better men.</p>

<p class='c007'>A letter from Naples, dated the 29th of October, gave
the following affecting account of the interview between Victor
Emanuel and Garibaldi:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"I was on my way to the head-quarters of Victor Emanuel, at
Teano, and took a cut through the mountains. While waiting for a
conveyance, I met Major Cattabene, commandant of Garibaldi's
head-quarters. He was coming from Teano, and to him I am indebted for
the following account of the interview between Victor Emanuel and
Garibaldi. Garibaldi had taken up his quarters at a small inn, about
four miles and a half between Teano and Speranzano, on the 25th.
He ordered his column to advance and take up positions, and sent
Count Trecchi to see the king. On the following morning, Count
Trecchi and Missori came to inform him that Cialdini was within an
hour's march, and the king not far behind. Garibaldi left immediately
with his staff, and three-quarters of an hour afterward he came in
sight of the head of the Piedmontese column. He put spurs to his
horse. The Piedmontese advanced as follows: the 23d and 24th
regiments of the Como Brigade; the 26th and 27th of Pinerolo's
Brigade; and then a battery of rifle cannon. The columns presented
arms to Garibaldi, and opened to allow him to pass through. Cialdini
rushed forward, and Garibaldi, jumping from his horse, embraced him
affectionately. After exchanging a few words, Garibaldi remounted
to meet the king. Victor Emanuel was not far behind, leading on
his own division. Seeing the red shirts, the king took his telescope,
and, recognizing Garibaldi, put spurs to his horse and galloped toward
him. Garibaldi did the same. When they were within ten paces of
<a id='Page_438'></a>each other, the officers of the king and of Garibaldi shouted, 'Long
live Victor Emanuel!' Garibaldi advanced, took off his hat, and in
a voice somewhat hoarse with emotion, said, 'King of Italy!' Victor
Emanuel put his hand to his kepi, then held it out to Garibaldi,
and equally moved, replied, 'Thank you.' They stood thus, hand
in hand, nearly a minute, without uttering another word.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi and the king, still holding each other's hand, followed
the troops for about a quarter of an hour. Their suites had mingled
together, and followed at a short distance behind them. Passing a
group of officers, Garibaldi saluted them. Among them were Farini,
minister of war, in the foraging cap of a staff officer, and General
Fanti. The king and Garibaldi were conversing. After the king followed
the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th regiments of the line, then sixty
guns, and four regiments of cavalry. His majesty was at the head
of 30,000 men.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Before reaching Teano, King Victor Emanuel halted, and ordered a
portion of his army to file off in presence of Garibaldi, that every
one might observe the good feeling which prevailed between him and
the chieftain. He then reviewed Bixio's Brigade, which was posted
a little beyond Calvi. He was received with the enthusiastic and
unanimous shout of 'Long live the King of Italy!' Garibaldi has
7,000 men divided between different positions. The king remained
at Teano; Garibaldi returned to Calvi to give orders."</span></p>

ADDRESS TO THE HUNGARIAN HUZZARS—HIS FAREWELL TO
HIS TROOPS—HE SAILS FOR CAPRERA—UNEXPECTED CHANGES
—LETTERS DESCRIBING THEM.</span></b></p>
<p class='c006'>The siege of Capua was now pressed; and, during its continuance,
the besiegers were joined by the Sardinian army,
which had already, after its victorious career through the
territories of the Pope, approached Naples.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi announced the approach of Victor Emanuel in
the following terms:</p>
<p class='c006'>PROCLAMATION OF GARIBALDI TO THE INHABITANTS OF NAPLES.</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"To-morrow, Victor Emanuel, the king of Italy, the elect of the
nation, will cross the line which has divided us from the rest of our
country for so many centuries; and, listening to the unanimous voice
of this brave population, will appear here among us. Let us receive,
in a becoming manner, him who is sent by Providence, and scatter in
his path, as a pledge of our rescue and of our affection, the flower of
concord, so grateful to him, so necessary to Italy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_440'></a><span class='small'>"No more political distinctions! no more parties! no more discords!
Italy one, as the people of this metropolis have expressed it,
and the gallant king, be the perennial symbols of our regeneration
and of the greatness and prosperity of the country.</span></p>
<div class='c011'>"<span class='sc'>G. Garibaldi.</span>"</div>
<p class='c006'>Victor Emanuel and Garibaldi entered Naples together,
on the 7th of October. The following animated description
of the scene is from a letter of that date.</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"King Victor Emanuel and Garibaldi entered Naples together, for
it would have been a grievous thing if, as had been feared, the apostle
of Italian liberty, the man of a century, had not been united with the
sovereign on this great occasion. When they left the railway <i>en route</i>
for the cathedral, there were Victor Emanuel and Garibaldi on his
left hand, and the pro-dictators of Sicily and Naples sitting opposite
them in the same carriage. The suite followed, and all along the
railway to the Duomo there was a perfect ovation. The streets, which
are very narrow, and scarcely wide enough to admit of more than
two fat persons abreast, were festooned with flowers and evergreens,
hung from window to window; pictures, tapestry, banners, and all
the adjuncts of a great <i>fête</i> in Naples were there, but looking as
<i>triste</i> and downcast as heavy rains could make them. On arriving at the
Duomo, or the cathedral, the piazza of which was beautifully decorated,
his majesty was received by the authorities, and conducted to
the high altar, amidst such a storm of shouts and applause as could
only be compared to the storm which was raging outside. 'Viva Victor
Emanuel!' 'Viva Garibaldi!' 'Viva Italia Unita!' Such were
the cries which rose, not from one, but from a united body of many
thousands, who waved their hats, and handkerchiefs, and flags, as the
royal party advanced to the high altar; and this in the cathedral
church of San Januarius, the special protector of the Bourbons, whose
favor (the saint's) Baron Brenier not long since requested as an honor
for M. Thouvenel.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The king did not take his seat on the throne, but stood a little
below it, and wiped his hands, and then his face, with his
pocket-handkerchief, and then looked round with that bold, undaunted
aspect which indicated an iron nerve. Shortly after, the ceremony began,
and his majesty knelt at the <i>prie-Dieu</i> (a stool for kneeling),
whilst Garibaldi, the pro-dictators, Farini, and others, stood behind
him. The <i>Te Deum</i> was sung in magnificent style.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"As soon as the ceremony was over, they came down the aisle, and
<a id='Page_441'></a>I had an admirable view of the king and the Liberator face to face,
and as a gleam of sun shone out on the monarch, every line was
visible. 'Humanity' came first, and 'Divinity' after. The difference
in the two expressions could not fail to strike the most insensible. I
looked at Victor Emanuel's unvarying face and bold glance, and said, he
is the <i>Re Galantuomo</i>, true to his word, and ready to maintain it
with his sword; but I looked on Garibaldi, and felt all the moral
grandeur of his character—not a statesman, because he is something
much higher—he carries in his face his character: an amiability which
wins all hearts, and an energy which overcomes all difficulties. The
crowd around each was immense, though the soldiers round the church
on either side did all they could to keep the path open, but it was all
of no use; one of the poorest of the poor laid hold of his sovereign's
hand and walked with him; and the people clung to Garibaldi and
kissed and embraced him as a father. He was the greater idol in a
temple of idols; and so the royal party walked down the church, and
entered their carriage in the midst of the bursts, and long-continued
storms of applause, as heretofore. The king was dressed, let me say,
as a general of division, and Garibaldi in the same simple dress in
which he had conquered the Two Sicilies and given away a kingdom.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"As the cathedral clergy refused to officiate on this occasion, the
clergy of the palace offered their services."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>On the 8th of November, the day after his entry into
Naples with the king, at eleven o'clock, Garibaldi, followed
by the ministry, presented to his majesty, in the throne-hall,
and in the prescribed form, the <i>Plebiscitum</i>, or Vote of the
People. The Minister of the Interior and Police thus
addressed the king:</p>
<p class='c006'>"<span class='sc'>Sire</span>: <span class='small'>The Neapolitan people, assembled in Comitia, by an
immense majority, have proclaimed you their king. Nine millions of
Italians unite themselves to the other provinces governed by your
majesty with so much wisdom, and verify your solemn promise that
Italy must belong to Italians."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The king answered in a few noble words. The act of
union was performed. The ministry then offered their resignation,
the dictatorship having expired from which they had
received their powers. The enthusiasm of the people of
Naples continued to be expressed in the highest degree.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_442'></a>The Capitulation of Capua was signed November 2, and,
abridged, was in these terms:</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"Convention on the capitulation of Capua, arranged by mutual
agreement, by order of his excellency, Gen. Della Rocca (commander
of the corps of the Sardinian army), commanding the besieging corps,
and by order of Field Marshal De Cornet, commanding the place, by
the undersigned commissaries, and afterward ratified by the respective
generals in command.</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-l c034'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"1. The place to be given up in twenty-four hours to the troops of</div>
      <div class='line'>Victor, with the entire armament, arms, clothes, provisions, bridge</div>
      <div class='line'>equipage, horses, carts, and all else, civil and military, belonging to</div>
      <div class='line'>the government.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. The gates and fortifications to be immediately</div>
      <div class='line'>given up.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. The garrison to march out with the honors of war.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. The forces to go with banners, arms and baggage, 2,000 men</div>
      <div class='line'>hourly, laying down their arms outside (officers retaining their</div>
      <div class='line'>swords), and proceeding to Naples on foot, embark for a Sardinian</div>
      <div class='line'>port. The generals to go to Naples by railroad. The families</div>
      <div class='line'>of soldiers not to follow the column. The sick and wounded to</div>
      <div class='line'>remain in Capua.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. A mixed commission to superintend affairs,</div>
      <div class='line'>and an inventory to be made," etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The scene presented at the surrender is thus described by
an American who was in Garibaldi's army.</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='small'>"At 7 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> we took up the line of march for Capua. The sun rose
in all his glory, after having hid his face for three days. The troops
were in the finest spirits, and decked their arms and colors with
branches and flowers, and as they marched up the road the bands
played the opera of 'Don Giovanni,' the troops joining in the chorus,
the gay Calabrese dancing with very joy. With such music as this,
with glorious mountains, and a beleaguered city lying prostrate before
us, you can imagine that we do not sigh for the Academy of
Music. At 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, 12,000 men laid down their arms in the beautiful
plain in front of the city. A sadder sight I have not witnessed since
the surrender of Vera Cruz to Lieutenant General Scott. The city
is now in the quiet possession of our troops, and all the cities in the
valley are illuminated. General Avezzana's division marched tonight
for Caserta, the palace of the king. Captain Warwick, the
young Virginian, is now with Colonel Wyndham, the gallant commander
of General Dunn's brigade (General Dunn having been
severely wounded). General Jackson, a major general of the
<a id='Page_443'></a>English army, has been here for three weeks past, lending his sympathy
and his presence, even upon the field of battle, to this glorious
cause.</span>
<span class='small'>"The palace and hunting park at Caserta are said to be the most
magnificent in the world."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>After the surrender of Capua, the battalions of volunteers
were disbanded, to be reorganized in the regular Italian
army, if they wished to remain in service. They were to be
sent to Northern and Central Italy, and disposed as follows:
The Medici division in Parma; the Turr division in
Palermo; the Cosenz in Bologna; and the Bixio in Florence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi asked of the king amnesty for all the soldiers
who had deserted from the Sardinian army to join his expeditions,
and the request was immediately granted to both
regulars and volunteers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi decreed as follows on the 15th of October:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"That the Two Sicilies, which owe their rescue to Italian blood,
and who have freely chosen me as Dictator, form an integral part
of Italy, one and indivisible, with her constitutional king, Victor
Emanuel, and his descendants."</span></p>
<p class='c006'>GARIBALDI'S ADDRESS ON DELIVERING FLAGS TO THE HUNGARIAN
HUSSARS IN NAPLES.</p>
<p class='c006'>"<span class='sc'>Neapolitans</span>: <span class='small'>This is a fine day—a great day! It is fine and
great, because it reunites, with a new chain, the brotherhood which
binds Italy to Hungary. The peoples are consolidated together.
The free Italians cannot, ought not, to forget it—nor will they forget
it." (Here the people broke out in overwhelming applause,
"<i>Viva Garibaldi!</i>" The general replied:) "Italians free! Yes,
they shall be—all, and soon. To a life wholly consecrated to the
cause of liberty—to the thought of our nationality—nothing else have
I added, nothing else do I wish to add, but the right to speak the
truth—to speak it equally to the powerful and the people.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Hear me, then, generous people of this great and beautiful metropolis,
and, if I deserve anything of you, believe my words.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"The canker, the ruin of our Italy, has always been personal
<a id='Page_444'></a>ambitions—and they are so still. It is personal ambitions which blind
the Pope-king, and urge him to oppose this national movement, so
great, so noble, so pure—yes, so pure—that it is unique in the history
of the world. It is the Pope-king who retards the moment of
the complete liberation of Italy. The only obstacle, the true obstacle,
is this.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"I am a Christian, and I speak to Christians—I am a good Christian,
and speak to good Christians. I love and venerate the religion
of Christ, because Christ came into the world to deliver humanity
from slavery, for which God has not created it. But the Pope, who
wishes all men to be slaves—who demands, of the powerful of the
earth, fetters and chains for Italians—the Pope-king does not know
Christ: he lies to his religion.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Among the Indians, two geniuses are recognized and adored—that
of good and that of evil. Well, the Genius of Evil for Italy is
the Pope-king. Let no one misunderstand my words—let no one
confound Popery with Christianity—the Religion of Liberty with the
avaricious and sanguinary Politics of Slavery.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Repeat that. Repeat it. It is your duty.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"You who are here—you, the educated and cultivated portion of
the citizenship—you have the duty to educate the people. Educate
them to be Christian—educate them to be Italian. Education gives
liberty—education gives to the people the means and the power to
secure and defend their own independence.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"On a strong and wholesome education of the people depend the
liberty and greatness of Italy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Viva Victor Emanuel! Viva Italia! Viva Christianity!"</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi's proclamation to his troops, when about to retire
to Caprera, commences thus:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>"<i>To my companions in arms!</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"We must consider the period which is now about to close as the
last step but one in our regeneration, and prepare ourselves to finish
splendidly the stupendous conception of the choice men of twenty
generations, the fulfillment of which Providence has assigned to this
fortunate generation.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Yes, young men! Italy owes to you an enterprise which deserves
the applause of the world. You have conquered, and you will
conquer, because you are now trained to the tactics which decide
battles. You have not degenerated from those who entered the
<a id='Page_445'></a>Macedonian phalanxes, and struck to the heart the proud conquerors
of Asia.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"This stupendous page of our history must be followed by one
more glorious still; and the slave will finally show to the free brother
a sharpened iron which belonged to the links of his chains.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"To arms all!—all!—and the oppressors, the supremely powerful,
shall be turned into dust."</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Garibaldi embarked in the small steamer, Washington,
for his island, and was so eager to be once more in retirement,
that he cast off the hawser with his own hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following account of his arrival at Caprera we translate
from a letter dated:</p>
<div class='c033'><span class='small'>"<span class='sc'>Milan</span>, <i>Nov. 16, 1860</i>.</span></div>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"By the return of the steamer Washington to Naples, we have
received direct news from the Island of Caprera, where Garibaldi has
established his winter quarters. As soon as he placed his foot on
shore in the island, the dictator felt himself free as from an incubus
weighing on his mind and heart. As Garibaldi never could remain
inactive under so seductive a sky, like Victor Emanuel, he is in his
element only when in the field of battle, or hunting among rocks. In
fact, he speaks of the re-conquest of his own individual liberty, which
he wishes to divide with his three war-horses, which, when he had
first stepped on the sand on the island, he unbridled and left free
among the fields.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"But a pleasing surprise came, on his arrival, to enliven the mind
of the Italian hero. The modest cottage which had served him as
an abode the past year, during his absence had been changed for a
handsome and elegant <i>casino</i>. The avenues were well marked out,
and, instead of the nakedness of the ground, the wild and uncultivated
aspect in which he had last seen it, he observed marks of recent
cultivation, plantations of trees and hedges, well arranged, convenient
and well-made roads.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi, full of wonder, went about trying to imagine and divine
what magical hand could have made so great a change. He even almost
began to doubt whether it was the Island of Caprera. Entering the
house, and looking about in every part, he found in the centre a rich
and commodious hall, and, supported from the wall, a large and beautiful
portrait. It was one of Victor Emanuel!"</span></p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_446'></a>The following is from a letter of the Rev. J. Newman,
dated "Naples, November, 1860:"</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>AN INTERVIEW WITH GARIBALDI.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was my good fortune to have an interview with General
Garibaldi, in the royal palace at Caserta, a day or two
before his departure. When I arrived at the palace, the
dictator was in the king's garden, sitting for his photograph—a
pretty Italian lady acting as artist. General Turr, and
the other officers of his staff, were present; also the wife of
the mayor of Palermo, and two other ladies. As in ordinary
cases, the artist had great difficulty in arranging the
general's head and hands, but still more in getting him to
keep them arranged, according to order. And after the
picture was finished, he was the first to look at it, which
he jocosely pronounced <i>good</i>. He then walked with one
of his staff, and again with the mayor's wife, through the
broad avenues of the garden, and finally strolled off alone,
with his arms thrown behind and his head inclined forward,
like one in deep reflection.</p>

<p class='c007'>He kindly received me into his private apartments in the
palace, where, by a most winning manner, he made me
feel myself quite at home. Learning that I was an American,
and having himself travelled through North and South
America, the conversation turned upon the United States.
He indicated his comprehensive and penetrating mind by a
marvellous familiarity with our history and prosperity.
Nothing can exceed the grace and dignity with which he
conversed. He was mild in his manner till I suggested the
great want of railroads in Italy, when he immediately grew
animated, and drew a striking contrast between Italy and
America, as to material greatness, and concluded with expressions
of hope that a brighter day is dawning upon his
native land. Garibaldi is so justly proud of his American
antecedents, that it is not egotism for me to claim for our
country an important agency in the Italian Revolution, by
<a id='Page_447'></a>the impressions our institutions and greatness made upon his
mind while there. My previous admiration for the man was
increased by this brief interview. He seemed to me to be
a man of exalted purpose and of generous sympathies. He
is now in the prime of life, and in the enjoyment of robust
health, which he preserves by his simple mode of living. He
is above the medium height, and has a powerful muscular
frame. His complexion is florid; his hair and beard sandy;
his brow lofty, and his eyes are of a light chestnut hue, and
when at ease they have that dreamy expression so peculiar
to many great men. He is not particularly dignified in his
address; his gait is even careless; his carriage might be
thought uncourtly, yet there is that indefinable something
in his presence which, while it does not overawe you, yet
impresses you with a profound respect for the man. He is
certainly an extraordinary character, and the most popular
man now before the world. He is honest in his principles,
unselfish in his purposes, unalterable in his decisions, lasting
in his friendships, bitter in his enmities, and magnanimous to
all. When I saw him he was attired in grey pants, a red
shirt, and a grey mantelet, lined with a red and black plaid,
the sides of which were looped upon his shoulders, giving
free play to his arms. He wore a Chinese cap, common in
England, and a serviceable sword was dangling at his side,
which constituted his uniform. His mode of living is
extremely simple, so much so that his staff joke him by saying
they do not expect to get much to eat where he is. He
never takes wine, and generally breakfasts upon a cup of
coffee and a few Italian chestnuts. He had formed the
decision to retire to his island home. If you will turn to
your map, you will see a little island on the northern coast
of Sardinia, near the entrance of the Straits of Bonifaccio,
and opposite to the southern point of Corsica. This is
Caprera, where the famous Garibaldi, with his son and
daughter, together with a few choice friends, is now residing.
The island is less than six miles in length and not two
<a id='Page_448'></a>in breadth. It consists of two rocks, which belonged to an
Englishman and the general. The former is now dead, and
Garibaldi is left alone in his rockland glory. But on reaching
his island, he was most agreeably surprised; the appearance
of his home had been so changed since he left. Well
cultivated fields and beautiful plantations, with shady groves
and spacious avenues, had taken the place of a stony desert.
It looked as if a magician had been there, and struck the
island with his wand, bidding nature forthwith to lavish her
treasures on this chosen spot. But the general was still
more surprised when, instead of his humble cottage, an elegant
villa stood before him; but on entering it the mystery
was solved, for on the wall hung the portrait of his friend
Victor Emanuel, whose generosity had anticipated his happiness.</p>
<p class='c006'>The following extract of an unpublished letter from a gentleman
in Piedmont to a friend in New York, contains a
most particular description of Garibaldi's arrival at Caprera:</p>
<div class='c033'><span class='small'>"<span class='sc'>Turin</span>, <i>Nov. 24, 1860</i>.</span></div>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"What do you say of all that has been passing here, and of Garibaldi,
the king-maker? You will have heard that this true patriot
refused the rank of first marshal of the kingdom of Italy, which would
have made him the first person after the king; and the order of
Annunziale, which is equal to that of the Golden Fleece, and generally
only given to born princes.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Garibaldi lives near the Island of Sardinia, on the small Isle of
Caprera, right in front of the Pass of Bonafaccio. It is a mere rock,
uninhabited or nearly so, where he has a small house and a little
garden, where he lives with his daughter, spending his time fishing.
To this hermitage he has retired, after having made a present to Victor
Emanuel of the kingdom of Naples. But you may fancy his surprise,
when, on arrival, he found his little garden had given room for
a park, with large trees, more than a century old, with flower-beds,
etc., etc. He entered his house. The outer walls were as he left
them; but the interior had become a palace, with magnificent furniture
and velvet hangings, with gold fringes, etc. He passed into the
study, and there above the massive mahogany table, hanging against
<a id='Page_449'></a>the wall, upon the velvet tapestry, a large painting, made by one of the
first artists of the day, in which he could not but recognize himself,
sitting at a table, his head bent over a drawing of a plan of
battle he was forming, while the king standing next him, his right
arm leaning familiarly on his shoulder, was looking, in a bending
position, at what he was doing.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>"Was this not a pretty surprise which the king prepared for his
faithful follower, the fisherman's son, who had given him a kingdom
and would accept nothing—neither rank, nor honors—in return?"</span></p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
